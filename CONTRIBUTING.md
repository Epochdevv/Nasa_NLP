2. **Documentation**: Improving README, adding tutorials, fixing typos
3. **Testing**: Writing tests, reporting bugs, testing new features
4. **Data**: Curating NASA publication datasets, improving data quality
5. **Design**: UI/UX improvements for the dashboard
6. **Ideas**: Suggesting new features or enhancements

## Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Nasa_NLP.git
   cd Nasa_NLP
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Development dependencies
   ```

5. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules
- Keep functions focused and small
- Maximum line length: 100 characters

### Code Formatting

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code with black
black .

# Sort imports with isort
isort .

# Lint code with flake8
flake8 .

# Type checking with mypy
mypy .
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Include integration tests for complex features

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Update your fork** with the latest changes from main:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run tests** to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   pytest
   black --check .
   flake8 .
   ```

3. **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**:
