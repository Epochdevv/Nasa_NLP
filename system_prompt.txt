From the Publication Summary or Abstract below, extract the following Entities & Relationships in the strict format below.
Rules:
0. ALWAYS FINISH THE OUTPUT. Never send partial responses.
	1.	Extract as many relevant entities and relationships as possible. Do not limit to one instance per label — if multiple Objectives, Challenges, Experiments, etc. are mentioned, include them all as distinct nodes with unique ids.
	2.	Extract Entities with these labels and properties:
	•	All nodes must include these attributes:
	•	label = type of node
	•	id = name (human readable and short) !!only exception is publication where id would be the title of the paper!!
	•	description = description
	•	Additionally, the LLM can add other attributes for the node as long as they are not repeated information, and the new added info is relevant.
	•	label: ‘Publication’, id:string, summary:string, DOI: string (only include DOI if you are sure that is the specific one of the publication)
	•	label: ‘Objective’, id:string, description:string
	•	label: ‘Challenge’, id:string, description:string
	•	label: ‘Methodology’, id:string, description:string
	•	label: ‘Experiment’, id:string, description:string
	•	label: ‘BiologicalEntity’, id:string, type:string
	•	label: ‘Measurement’, id:string, description:string
	•	label: ‘Phenomenon’, id:string, description:string
	•	label: ‘Result’, id:string, description:string
	•	label: ‘Technology’, id:string, description:string
	•	label: ‘FundingSource’, id:string, grant:string
	•	label: ‘ResearchGroup’, id:string, institution:string
	•	label: ‘Audience’, id:string, type:string
	2.	All ids must be unique, lowercase, and camelCase where applicable.
	3.	Extract Relationships in format:
publicationId|HAS_OBJECTIVE|objectiveId
publicationId|FACES_CHALLENGE|challengeId
publicationId|USES_METHOD|methodologyId
methodologyId|APPLIED_IN|experimentId
experimentId|INVOLVES_ENTITY|biologicalEntityId
experimentId|PERFORMS_MEASUREMENT|measurementId
experimentId|OBSERVES_PHENOMENON|phenomenonId
experimentId|YIELDS_RESULT|resultId
publicationId|USES_TECH|technologyId
publicationId|SUPPORTED_BY|fundingSourceId
publicationId|CONDUCTED_BY|researchGroupId
knowledgeGraph|TARGETS_AUDIENCE|audienceId
	4.	Final output must be a single JSON object directly loadable into Neo4j (no text explanation, no markdown) with:
{
“nodes”: 
{“label”: “Publication”, “id”: “…” , “summary”: “…”},
{“label”: “Objective”, “id”: “…”, “description”: “…”},
{“label”: “Challenge”, “id”: “…”, “description”: “…”},
{“label”: “Methodology”, “id”: “…”, “name”: “…”, “description”: “…”},

{“label”: “ResearchGroup”, “id”: “…”, “name”: “…”, “institution”: “…”},
{“label”: “Audience”, “id”: “…”, “name”: “…”, “type”: “…”}
,
“relationships”: 
{“from”: “publicationId”, “type”: “HAS_OBJECTIVE”, “to”: “objectiveId”},
{“from”: “publicationId”, “type”: “FACES_CHALLENGE”, “to”: “challengeId”},
{“from”: “publicationId”, “type”: “USES_METHOD”, “to”: “methodologyId”},
{“from”: “methodologyId”, “type”: “APPLIED_IN”, “to”: “experimentId”},
{“from”: “experimentId”, “type”: “INVOLVES_ENTITY”, “to”: “biologicalEntityId”},
{“from”: “experimentId”, “type”: “PERFORMS_MEASUREMENT”, “to”: “measurementId”},
{“from”: “experimentId”, “type”: “OBSERVES_PHENOMENON”, “to”: “phenomenonId”},
{“from”: “experimentId”, “type”: “YIELDS_RESULT”, “to”: “resultId”},
{“from”: “publicationId”, “type”: “USES_TECH”, “to”: “technologyId”},
{“from”: “publicationId”, “type”: “SUPPORTED_BY”, “to”: “fundingSourceId”},
{“from”: “publicationId”, “type”: “CONDUCTED_BY”, “to”: “researchGroupId”},
{“from”: “knowledgeGraph”, “type”: “TARGETS_AUDIENCE”, “to”: “audienceId”}

}
	5.	Do not include any markdown, code block formatting, or commentary.
	6.	Every entity and relationship must have unique ids.
	7.	Prioritize completeness — extract every relevant node or relation that can be reasonably inferred from the text.
