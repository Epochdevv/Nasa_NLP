<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The endomembrane system plays essential roles in plant development, but the proteome responsible for its function and organization remains largely uncharacterized in plants. Here, we identified and characterized the HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1) protein isolated through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis thaliana for mutants with heightened sensitivity to actin-disrupting drugs. HLB1 is a plant-specific tetratricopeptide repeat domain-containing protein of unknown function encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene. HLB1 associated with the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and tracked along filamentous actin, indicating that it could link post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton in plants. HLB1 was found to interact with the ADP-ribosylation-factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MIN7/BEN1 (HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1) by coimmunoprecipitation. The min7/ben1 mutant phenocopied the mild root developmental defects and latrunculin B hypersensitivity of hlb1, and analyses of a hlb1/ min7/ben1 double mutant showed that hlb1 and min7/ben1 operate in common genetic pathways. Based on these data, we propose that HLB1 together with MIN7/BEN1 form a complex with actin to modulate the function of the TGN/EE at the intersection of the exocytic and endocytic pathways in plants.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Normal plant development relies on the endomembrane system as it plays a central role in directing the delivery of enzyme complexes and polysaccharide precursors to the cell surface and to the vacuole <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Kim and Brandizzi, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Kim et al., 2015)</ref>. In addition, protein traffic through endomembranes is pivotal for specifying how plants respond and adapt to a range of biotic and abiotic stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Lozano-Durán et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Garcia de la Garma et al., 2015)</ref>. The endomembrane system is highly dynamic and consists of a network of functionally interconnected organelles beginning with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where proteins are synthesized and then trafficked to the plasma membrane (PM) and vacuole after processing and sorting in the Golgi apparatus and post-Golgi organelles <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(Richter et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Brandizzi and Barlowe, 2013)</ref>. Recycling and degradation of PM proteins, which also are facilitated by the endomembrane trafficking machinery, are essential for establishing and maintaining the polar localization of lipids and critical proteins, including auxin carriers, transmembrane receptors, channels, and ion transporters that regulate diverse physiological processes in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Geldner et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b98">Takano et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Barberon and Geldner, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Hachez et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Doyle et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Among the various organelles that comprise the endomembrane system, the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is arguably the most mysterious. The complexity of TGN function stems from the fact that it lies at the intersection of secretory and endocytic pathways, through which cargo destined for the PM and vacuole transit <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Contento and Bassham, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Gendre et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast to mammalian cells, there is mounting evidence that the TGN in plants functions as an early endosome (EE) that directly receives cargo taken up via endocytosis for recycling back to the PM or directed to the vacuole for degradation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dettmer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Viotti et al., 2010)</ref>. In recent years, much has been learned about the structure and dynamics of the plant TGN. Using transmission electron tomography on high-pressure frozen Arabidopsis thaliana roots, for example, it was shown that the formation of the TGN occurs through distinct structural changes including separation of trans-most Golgi cisterna via a peeling mechanism and secretory vesicle budding from the plane of the original trans-Golgi cisterna <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Kang et al., 2011)</ref>. In another study, live-cell spinning-disc confocal microscopy of Arabidopsis hypocotyl cells uncovered the formation of thin tube-like protrusions connecting two TGN/EE units prior to their homotypic fusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b110">(Viotti et al., 2010)</ref>. Furthermore, live-cell super-resolution microscopy described two types of TGN in Arabidopsis roots: a Golgi-associated TGN on the transside of the Golgi apparatus and a Golgi-independent TGN that moved independently of Golgi bodies <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Uemura et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In addition to new knowledge about its structure and dynamics, several protein components of the plant TGN have been discovered that mediate crucial aspects of post-Golgi membrane traffic and maintain TGN integrity. These TGN resident proteins include soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors, the so-called SYNTAXINS of PLANTS (SYPs), vacuolar H + -ATPases, adaptor protein complexes, small monomeric GTPases of the ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) and RAS genes from rat brain (RAB) families, and the ECHIDNA/YPT/RAB GTPase complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Dettmer et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Chow et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">Zouhar et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Gendre et al., 2011</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Gendre et al., , 2013;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">Uemura et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Asaoka et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">Naramoto et al., 2014)</ref>. Whereas many of the plant TGN-localized proteins are evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes, some appear to be unique to the plant post-Golgi trafficking machinery <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ebine et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Ebine et al., , 2011;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012)</ref>, and it is likely that more factors remain uncharacterized.</p><p>Mobility of organelles within the cell is typically driven by the cytoskeleton, a network of filamentous proteins that consists of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments.</p><p>Microfilaments, also known as filamentous actin (F-actin), assemble in an energy-dependent manner from monomeric globular actin (G-actin) units to form two-stranded, helical structures that are ;5 to 7 nm in diameter <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Li et al., 2014)</ref>. The higher order organization of the actin cytoskeleton consists mostly of bundles and cables, and their assembly into these structures is specified by several actin binding proteins such as fimbrin, villin, profilin, LIM domain-containing proteins, thrumin, and crolin <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Papuga et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b113">Whippo et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Su et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Jia et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Qu et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Sun et al., 2013)</ref>. The movement and dynamics of the ER and the various organelles that make up the plant endomembrane system are largely dependent on the actin cytoskeleton, as demonstrated using actin-disrupting drugs such as latrunculin B (LatB) and cytochalasin D <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Boevink et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Nebenführ et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Sparkes et al., 2009)</ref>. However, actin appears to be dispensable for protein transport between the ER and Golgi apparatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brandizzi et al., 2002)</ref>. While it was shown that cargo traffic from the Golgi to the vacuoles requires an intact actin cytoskeleton, the underlying mechanisms by which this process is accomplished are unknown <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kim et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>There is a wealth of information on the relationship between post-Golgi traffic and its mediation by the actin cytoskeleton in yeast and animal cells. Most of the evidence to date in these systems has pointed toward a pivotal role for F-actin and its associated regulatory and motor proteins in post-Golgi vesicle biogenesis and membrane deformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Anitei and Hoflack, 2012)</ref>. In mammalian HeLa cells, for example, myosin 1b was shown to generate the forces that regulate the assembly of F-actin foci for tubule formation at the TGN <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Almeida et al., 2011)</ref>. In another class of mammalian cells called 3T3, the actin-related protein 2/3 (ARP2/3) complex and their activators in the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) family drive the nucleation of F-actin on endosomes, which is necessary to promote endosome fission <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Derivery et al., 2009)</ref>. Recently, a combination of elegant optical tweezer and live-cell confocal imaging in human epithelial cells demonstrated that the actin cytoskeleton confers rigidity to the Golgi complex, making it stiffer than the surrounding cytoplasm. It was proposed that mechanical stress imposed by actin affects membrane budding and fission during intra-Golgi transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Guet et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>In plants, several actin binding proteins appear to link actin dynamics with membrane trafficking. Many of these proteins, such as the ARP2/3 complex, profilin, formins, and capping proteins, which localize to the PM and various membranes of organelles within the endomembrane system, have orthologs in other eukaryotes <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">(Zhang et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">(Zhang et al., , 2013;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Sun et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Jimenez-Lopez et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Cvr cková et al., 2015)</ref>. In fact, some of the mechanisms by which F-actin on membranes is nucleated and polymerized in plants mirror those of animals and yeast, where small GTPases of the Rho family directly activate membrane-localized actin nucleators <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">(Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007)</ref>. For example, genetic and biochemical studies in Arabidopsis showed that a Rho of plants (ROP)-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) protein called SPIKE1 regulates F-actin polymerization through the ARP2/3 complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Basu et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b116">Zhang et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, a number of plant-specific proteins that function as actin membrane adaptors have been uncovered. One example is RISAP, a TGN-localized ROP-GTPase effector that interacts with F-actin and binds to the globular tail domain of myosin XI in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) pollen tubes. RISAP is ;33% identical to the Arabidopsis family of myosin binding proteins at the amino acid level <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Peremyslov et al., 2013)</ref>. It was proposed that the RISAP-mediated interaction between the actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane system is an essential component of the tip growth machinery in pollen tubes <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">(Stephan et al., 2014)</ref>. Another family of plant-specific proteins that mediate actin-endomembrane crosstalk is the 13-member Networked (NET) proteins. These NET proteins interacted directly with F-actin through a conserved N-terminal domain. The NET proteins were also shown to localize to PM-ER contact sites and the tonoplast <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Deeks et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b111">Wang et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we report the discovery of a plant-specific protein called HLB1 (for HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1) through a forward-genetic screen in Arabidopsis seedlings for mutants that exhibited differential responses to the inhibitory effects of LatB on primary root growth. We determined that HLB1 tracks along F-actin and colocalizes with the TGN/EE in vivo and that hlb1 has marked defects in the recycling of proteins to the PM after endocytic uptake. Furthermore, we identified the ARF-GEF, MIN7/BEN1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Nomura et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Tanaka et al., 2009)</ref>, as an HLB1 interactor and showed that hlb1 functions in a common genetic pathway as min7/ben1 in regard to LatB hypersensitivity despite their opposite effects on membrane trafficking. These findings are significant because they support the conclusion that HLB1 represents a class of plant-specific proteins that function at the crossroads of exocytic and endocytic trafficking pathways, possibly through mechanisms coordinated by the actin cytoskeleton.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isolation and Characterization of Arabidopsis Mutants Hypersensitive to LatB</head><p>Approximately 20,000 T-DNA activation-tagged seedlings in the Col-0 background were grown on media supplemented with 100 nM LatB. Seedlings with significantly reduced primary root length were isolated and their progeny were retested for increased LatB sensitivity. Three nonallelic mutants whose primary roots were hypersensitive to LatB were identified and hlb1 was selected for further study <ref type="bibr">(Figures 1A to 1D)</ref>. Hypocotyls of hlb1 grown in the dark and root hairs of light-grown seedlings were also hypersensitive to LatB (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Moreover, hlb1 primary roots displayed increased sensitivity to cytochalasins, another class of actindisrupting compounds (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). Analysis of 224 F2 seedlings revealed a 172:52 segregation of wild type:mutant for a 3:1 ratio (calculated x 2 = 0.381 &lt; x 2 0.95 = 3.841), indicating that hlb1 is recessive in a single Mendelian locus. Homozygous hlb1 plants were backcrossed at least three times with Col-0 to reduce the frequency of extraneous mutations.</p><p>Osmotic stress, salt stress, and the auxins indole-3-acetic acid and 1-naphthaleneacetic acid inhibited primary root growth in hlb1 to a similar extent as in the wild type, indicating that hlb1 is hypersensitive only to LatB and cytochalasin, compounds that directly interfere with actin polymerization (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). The response of other mutants to genes encoding actin regulatory proteins including single mutants brk1, arp2, adf4, cpa1, cpb1, and cpb3 and quadruple mutant scar1234 <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Mathur et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Dyachok et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Li et al., 2012</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Li et al., , 2015;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Henty-Ridilla et al., 2014)</ref> to LatB was also compared with hlb1. These mutants exhibited wild-type sensitivity to LatB. act8, a mutant of a root-expressed vegetative actin isoform, also showed wild-type sensitivity to LatB. Although act2, a mutant of another root-expressed vegetative actin isoform <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Kandasamy et al., 2009)</ref>, was hypersensitive to LatB, its heightened sensitivity to the chemical was not as severe as that of hlb1 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cell Division, Cell Expansion, and F-Actin Organization in hlb1 Are Hypersensitive to LatB</head><p>We asked whether the increased sensitivity of hlb1 roots to LatB could be explained by inhibition of cell division, cell expansion, or both. To address this question, cortical cell length in the root elongation zone and cortical cell number in the meristem was obtained from confocal microscopy analyses of propidium iodidestained roots 2 d after transplanting seedlings on media with or without 50 nM LatB (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>). Both cortical cell number in the root meristem and cortical cell length in the elongation zone were reduced in LatB-treated hlb1 seedlings compared with the wild type, indicating that inhibition of both processes contributed to the hypersensitivity of the mutant to the drug (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B to 5E</ref>).</p><p>We next analyzed F-actin organization in cells of the elongation zone of wild-type and hlb1 seedlings expressing the live-cell F-actin reporter UBQ10pro:GFP-ABD2-GFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dyachok et al., 2014)</ref> transplanted to growth media with or without 50 nM LatB. Cells in the root elongation zone of both genotypes on control medium showed dense and random F-actin arrays, a feature typical of cells within this region (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>). When transplanted on LatB, wild-type cells maintained their dense network of F-actin that roughly mirrored the controls with the exception of a few fluorescent aggregates. By contrast, cells in the root elongation zone of LatB-treated hlb1 had mostly diffuse fluorescence, fewer distinct F-actin arrays, and more numerous fluorescent aggregates compared with the wild type (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>). To quantify the effect of LatB on F-actin integrity, filament density (occupancy) in cells from the elongation zone was measured using an algorithm developed earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Higaki et al., 2010)</ref>. Whereas the wild type and hlb1 on the control medium and wild type on LatBsupplemented medium had similar occupancy values, LatB-treated hlb1 had significantly lower F-actin occupancy values, indicating  that F-actin structures of hlb1 were indeed more sensitive to the chemical (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>).</p><p>hlb1 Exhibits Reduced Root Hair and Primary Root Growth in the Absence of LatB Close examination of hlb1 seedlings revealed that they had mild growth defects even when LatB was excluded from the growth medium. Primary roots of hlb1 were slightly shorter than the wild type at 3, 5, and 7 d after planting (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3B</ref>). hlb1 root hairs were also shorter than those of the wild type <ref type="bibr">(Figures 3C to 3E)</ref>. Furthermore, differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy showed that hlb1 root hairs were wider and had subtle shape distortions when compared with wild-type root hairs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3F</ref>).</p><p>As noted, distinct qualitative and quantitative differences in F-actin organization in cells of the root elongation zone were observed between wild-type and hlb1 seedlings but only when treated with 50 nM LatB (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). We therefore evaluated F-actin dynamics in root hairs, where growth differences between the wild type and hlb1 appeared to be more pronounced <ref type="bibr">(Figures 3C to 3F)</ref>. In wild-type seedlings, the majority of the actively elongating root hairs were characterized by a distinct enrichment of fine and dynamic meshwork of F-actin at the extreme apex (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>; Supplemental Movie 1). In hlb1 root hairs, the tip-focused fine meshwork of F-actin was not always observed, and in cases where it was present, it would often dissipate rapidly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4A</ref>; Supplemental Movie 1). Similar results were obtained with wild-type and hlb1 root hairs expressing the F-actin marker UBQ10pro: Lifeact-mGFP, which was previously reported to clearly label apical F-actin meshwork at the apex of pollen tubes and moss protonema <ref type="bibr" target="#b108">(Vidali et al., 2009)</ref>. Using a 1003 oil immersion objective on the spinning-disc confocal microscope, wild-type root hairs expressing UBQ10pro:Lifeact-mGFP had distinct filamentous meshwork at the tip that would often dissipate in the tips of hlb1 root hairs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>; Supplemental Movie 2). F-actin tip dynamics in the wild type and hlb1 were quantified from 3-min time-lapse movies of growing roots hairs by obtaining the ratio of the total time where the apical meshwork of F-actin was clearly visible to the total time elapsed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4B</ref>). This ratio provided an indication of the percentage of time that the root hair was able to maintain its tip-focused fine meshwork of F-actin as it elongated. These analyses showed that hlb1 root hairs had a significantly lower ratio value than the wild type, indicating that the mutant largely failed to maintain its tipfocused fine meshwork of F-actin (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4C</ref>).</p><p>We also asked whether hlb1 mutants had any measureable differences in global F-actin dynamics when compared with the wild type. Global F-actin dynamics was quantified from time-lapse movie sequences obtained from a spinning-disc confocal microscope using the metrics of pixel difference and correlation values developed earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">(Vidali et al., 2010)</ref>. For this type of analysis, we focused our imaging on cortical F-actin in root epidermal cells in the mature zone and the center of growing root hairs because cells in these areas of the root stayed within the same field of view during the entire 1-min time-lapse sequence (Supplemental Movie 3). Time-lapse data sets from epidermal cells of the root transition or elongation zone were significantly displaced as the primary root grew in the medium and therefore were not suitable for the global F-actin analysis described here. Based on changes in pixel difference and correlation coefficient decay, there were no dramatic differences in global F-actin dynamics between the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cloning of the Gene Conferring the hlb1 Phenotype</head><p>Because attempts to identify the mutation responsible for the hlb1 phenotype by standard thermal asymmetric interlaced-PCR were unsuccessful, we conducted map-based cloning to identify the HLB1 gene. We found that the AT5G41950 gene had a 2-bp deletion in the first exon corresponding to amino acid 63 in the hlb1 mutant (Arabidopsis Chromosome 5 Positions 16786010 and 16786011). This frameshift mutation resulted in a premature stop codon at amino acid 67, which may possibly lead to a truncated protein (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7A</ref>). To confirm whether loss of AT5G41950 corresponds to hlb1, we searched the publicly available SALK collection for T-DNA insertions in the AT5G41950 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alonso et al., 2003)</ref>. We genotyped the segregating progeny by PCR and identified homozygous plants for three SALK lines (SALK_046760, SALK_144501, and SALK_065836), which had insertions in the 8th exon, the 7th intron, and the 10th intron of AT5G41950, respectively (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7B</ref>). Seedlings of these three T-DNA insertion mutants exhibited similar hypersensitivity to LatB and root hair growth defects as hlb1, indicating that these were mutant alleles of hlb1 (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7D</ref>). The original hlb1 mutant was designated as hlb1-1, whereas SALK_046760, SALK_144501, and SALK_065836 were named hlb1-2, hlb1-3, and hlb1-4, respectively (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7B</ref>). The average primary root length was significantly less than that of the wild type only in hlb1-2, which had an insertion in an exon, suggesting that hlb1-3 and hlb1-4 are weaker alleles (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7D</ref>). The hlb1-1 mutant allele was used for the analyses detailed below. Further evidence showing that hlb1 is linked to AT5G41950 was obtained from functional complementation of hlb1 by expression of an HLB1-GFP fusion protein that restored the wild-type phenotype (see below).</p><p>HLB1 Is a Tetratricopeptide Repeat-Containing Protein Encoded by a Single Arabidopsis Gene HLB1 encodes a 565-amino acid protein of unknown function (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>). We analyzed 141 HLB1 homologs from 79 plant species to understand their phylogenetic relationship. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred by the maximum likelihood method <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Le and Gascuel, 2008</ref>) using MEGA6 software <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Tamura et al., 2013)</ref>. Based on this analysis, HLB1 appears to be well conserved across the land plant lineage (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>). Sequence alignment of HLB1 homologs from six plant species representing moss, monocots, and eudicots showed that HLB1 has a highly variable N terminus, six tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs, and a well conserved C terminus predicted to form a helical structure. The conservation of amino acids at the C terminus of several plant HLB1 proteins suggests that HLB1 has functional domains that have yet to be characterized (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B</ref>).</p><p>Including HLB1, the Arabidopsis genome has 147 proteins containing a total of 839 TPR motifs that are predicted to function in a range of biological processes and localize to a variety of subcellular compartments (Supplemental Data Set 1). However, HLB1 has no paralogs among any of the 146 TPR motif-containing Arabidopsis proteins, indicating that it exists as a single gene. Furthermore, HLB1 is specific to land plants, as no homologous sequences were identified in fungi and animals. TPR domains mediate protein-protein interactions, and proteins containing these domains are part of protein complexes with diverse functions including transcriptional repression, protein import, heat shock, and cell cycle regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blatch and Lässle, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">D'Andrea and Regan, 2003)</ref>.

HLB1 Colocalizes with TGN and EE Markers through Its Conserved C-Terminal Domain HLB1 fusions to GFP under the control of the native HLB1 promoter (HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP) and the CaMV 35S promoter (35Spro:GFP-HLB1) were generated to gain more insight into HLB1 function. Both HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP and 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 complemented the LatB-hypersensitive and root hair phenotypes of hlb1-1 in young seedlings, indicating that the HLB1 fluorescent protein fusions are functional (Figures 6A and 6B; Supplemental Figure 9).</p><p>Confocal microscopy of cells from the elongation zone and root hairs of hlb1-1 seedlings expressing HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP revealed that the fusion protein localized to the cytoplasm and decorated distinct and dynamic foci (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6D</ref>; Supplemental Movie 4). The fluorescent bodies decorated by HLB1-GFP were reminiscent of those observed in plant cells expressing fluorescently tagged compartments of the endomembrane system <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Geldner et al., 2009)</ref>. Endomembrane compartments such as endosomes visualized with GFP have been shown to form large intracellular fluorescent agglomerates when treated with the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A (BFA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Robinson et al., 2008)</ref>. Consistent with the hypothesis that the HLB1-GFP bodies were associated with the endomembrane system, seedlings expressing HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP treated with 50 mM BFA for 1 h developed intracellular fluorescent agglomerates (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6E</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6F</ref>).</p><p>To determine the identity of the endomembrane compartment with which HLB1 is associated, HLB1pro:HLB1-GFP lines were crossed with a set of marker lines expressing mCherry and CFP endomembrane markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Nelson et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Geldner et al., 2009)</ref>. HLB1-GFP overlapped substantially with the TGN markers mCherry-VTI12 and SYP61-CFP and an early/recycling endosomal marker, mCherry-RabA1g (Figures 7A to 7D; Supplemental Movies 5 and 6), but not with the Golgi marker Man49-mCherry. Although the bodies decorated by HLB1-GFP and Man49-mCherry were clearly distinct, many HLB1-GFP bodies were adjacent to the larger Golgi bodies and often moved alongside Golgi stacks, a feature typical of TGN dynamics (Supplemental Movie 7) <ref type="bibr" target="#b105">(Uemura et al., 2014)</ref>. A number of HLB1-GFP bodies were also observed to move independently of Man49-mCherry (Supplemental Movie 7). HLB1-GFP did not overlap substantially with mCherry-ARA6, a marker for the late endosomes/prevacuolar compartment (PVC) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7E</ref>; Supplemental Movie 8). The extent of colocalization of HLB1-GFP with selected endomembrane markers was quantified by extracting Pearson's correlation coefficients from scatterplots of green-red image pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Manders et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Costes et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bottanelli et al., 2012)</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7F</ref>). The Pearson's correlation coefficient was higher in the HLB1-GFP-mCherry-VTI12 pair when compared with the HLB1-GFP-mCherry-RabA1g pair. The higher value for the HLB1-GFP-mCherry-VTI12 pair indicates that HLB1 foci are associated more closely with the VTI12-resident TGN/EE population and to a lesser extent with recycling endosomes decorated by RabA1g (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7G</ref>). Lower Pearson's correlation coefficients were obtained from the HLB1-GFP-mCherry-ARA6 pair, consistent with visual observations of minimal overlap between HLB1 and late endosomes/PVC (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7E</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7G</ref>; Supplemental Movie 8). Together, these data strongly support the conclusion that HLB1 is a TGN/EE-localized protein.</p><p>As noted above, HLB1 contains six TPR motifs and a conserved C-terminal domain of unknown function. To determine whether these domains target HLB1 to the TGN/EE, we generated GFP fusions to truncated HLB1 where either the six TPR motifs (GFP-HLB1 ΔTPR ) or the conserved C terminus (GFP-HLB1 ΔCTD ) was deleted (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10A</ref>). When expressed in seedlings, the GFP-HLB1 ΔCTD fusion that had the intact TPR motifs localized exclusively to the cytoplasm. By contrast, the GFP-HLB1 ΔTPR with the conserved C terminus localized to both the cytoplasm and TGN/EE bodies, similar to the localization of full-length HLB1 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10B</ref>). Taken together, the data indicate that the C terminus of HLB1 is responsible for its localization to the TGN/EE.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HLB1-GFP Bodies Track along F-Actin in Planta</head><p>Given that the hlb1 mutant is hypersensitive to LatB, we tested the association of HLB1-GFP TGNs with F-actin in planta. HLB1-GFP plants were crossed with plants expressing the red fluorescent F-actin construct UBQ10pro:mCherry-ABD2-mCherry <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dyachok et al., 2014)</ref>. It was difficult to obtain clear images of mCherry-ABD2-mCherry and HLB1-GFP bodies together in root cells that were highly cytoplasmic because the HLB1-GFP cytoplasmic component would often obscure the red F-actin label. Thus, imaging of mCherry-ABD2-mCherry and HLB1-GFP was conducted on vacuolated epidermal cells of the root maturation zone and fully mature root hairs, where signal from the cytoplasm was minimal. In these cell types, HLB1-GFP bodies aligned with and tracked along F-actin bundles in a "beads-on-a-string"-like localization, typical of actin membrane adaptors such as the NET proteins, which are associated with the actin cytoskeleton in vivo (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8B</ref>; Supplemental Movies 9 and 10) <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Wang et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>The increased sensitivity of hlb1 to LatB prompted us to ask whether the HLB1-GFP bodies themselves responded to LatB treatment. We found that roots of seedlings formed intracellular HLB1-GFP agglomerates within 10 min of LatB application. However, other TGN markers, including YFP-VTI12 and SYP61-CFP, formed similar aggregates as HLB1-GFP after LatB treatment, indicating that the compound has a global effect on TGN distribution in root cells (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Rice Ortholog of Arabidopsis HLB1 Partially Complements hlb1</head><p>Bioinformatic analyses indicated that HLB1 is a highly conserved protein that did not diverge much during the split between eudicots and monocots (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">8</ref>). To test whether an HLB1 ortholog from a monocot could have similar functions as the Arabidopsis HLB1, the rice (Oryza sativa) HLB1 gene (Os-HLB1) was cloned and a 35Spro:OsHLB1-GFP construct was generated. The OsHLB1-GFP fusion partially complemented the LatB-hypersensitive phenotype of Arabidopsis hlb1 but fully complemented its short primary root defects. Furthermore, OsHLB1-GFP localized to the cytoplasm and labeled similar dynamic punctate bodies as the Arabidopsis HLB1-GFP in the hlb1-1 mutant background (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12B</ref>). The partial complementation of hlb1 by OsHLB1-GFP and similar localization patterns as the Arabidopsis HLB1 supports the conclusion that the role of HLB1 in endomembrane traffic is likely conserved in land plants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coimmunoprecipitation Identifies HOPM INTERACTOR7/ BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1 as a Potential HLB1 Interactor</head><p>Because TPR domains are known to mediate protein-protein interactions (D'Andrea and Regan, 2003), coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed to identify proteins interacting with HLB1 using roots of hlb1-1 seedlings complemented with the 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 construct (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>). Seedlings expressing 35Spro:GFP served as control plants. GFP-HLB1 and its putative interactors were coimmunoprecipitated using anti-GFP serum. Coimmunoprecipitated proteins from 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 and 35Spro:GFP seedlings were analyzed with SDS-PAGE, and the components were identified by mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Peptides corresponding to both HLB1 and GFP were readily detected in the coimmunoprecipitates from the roots of the 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 line, indicating successful isolation of chimeric GFP-HLB1 from the root extracts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9A</ref>; Supplemental Data Set 2).</p><p>Two independent co-IP experiments were conducted, and proteins present in 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 immunoprecipitates but not in 35Spro:GFP controls were considered for further analyses.    Surprisingly, the first co-IP experiment yielded a limited number of proteins with only 22 proteins unique to 35Spro:GFP-HLB1. By contrast, the second co-IP experiment yielded ;650 proteins unique to 35Spro:GFP-HLB1. It is unclear why there was a large discrepancy in the protein list between two independent co-IP experiments. In both co-IP experiments, however, peptides of HOPM INTERACTOR7/BREFELDIN A-VISUALIZED ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING DEFECTIVE1 (MIN7/BEN1) were detected as unique to 35Spro:GFP-HLB1 root extracts <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Nomura et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Tanaka et al., 2009)</ref>. To validate the results of the two co-IP experiments, a reciprocal co-IP was conducted with root extracts of 35Spro:MIN7/BEN1-GFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Nomura et al., 2011)</ref>. Consistent with the possibility that MIN7/BEN1 interacts with HLB1, HLB1 peptides were identified in the immunoprecipitates of 35Spro:MIN7/BEN1-GFP but not in the 35Spro:GFP controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9A</ref>).</p><p>MIN7/BEN1 has been previously shown to localize to the TGN/ EE and function in endocytosis of PM proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Tanaka et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Nomura et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Tanaka et al., 2013)</ref>. Therefore, its connection to HLB1 was evaluated in more detail. Genetic and pharmacological evidence that MIN7/BEN1 is biologically relevant to HLB1 function was obtained from analyses of min7/ben1 mutants (SALK_013761), which we refer to here as ben1 for simplicity. Roots of the ben1 mutant were hypersensitive to LatB, as much as hlb1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9B</ref>). Even in the absence of LatB, ben1 had short primary roots and root hairs, mirroring hlb1 phenotypes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9C</ref>; Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13</ref>). To determine if HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 colocalized in planta, we generated an HLB1-mCherry fusion and expressed it in plants harboring MIN7/BEN1-GFP <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Nomura et al., 2011)</ref>. Spinning-disc confocal microscopy observations followed by quantitative colocalization analyses revealed that HLB1-mCherry bodies overlapped significantly with MIN7/BEN1-GFP foci, providing support to our co-IP results that the two proteins indeed interact in vivo (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9D</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9E</ref>; Supplemental Movie 11).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The ben1 and hlb1 Mutations Affect Distinct Membrane Trafficking Pathways</head><p>A mutant allele of ben1 was isolated from a confocal microscopybased forward-genetic screen for defects in the internalization of the PIN-FORMED (PIN) PM-localized auxin efflux carriers. ben1 was found to be defective in endocytic trafficking as it had diminished ability to form PIN-GFP agglomerates when treated with BFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Tanaka et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Tanaka et al., , 2013))</ref>. Because ben1 mirrored the LatB hypersensitivity and root hair phenotypes of hlb1 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>), we hypothesized that hlb1 could also have defects in the formation of intracellular PIN agglomerates when exposed to BFA. PIN2-GFP was therefore expressed in hlb1 and treated with BFA. Like wild-type roots, hlb1 roots accumulated intracellular PIN2-GFP agglomerates after 1 h exposure to 50 mM BFA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10A</ref>). Although the number of PIN2-GFP agglomerates per cell in hlb1 and the wild type was not statistically different, fluorescence of BFA-induced agglomerates was more intense in hlb1 compared with the wild type when imaged under similar confocal microscopy settings (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10C</ref>). The stronger fluorescence intensity of PIN2-GFP agglomerates in hlb1 prompted us to ask whether the hlb1  mutation might be affecting the recycling of PIN2-GFP to the PM. To address this question, BFA washout experiments were conducted on wild-type and hlb1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP. After 1 to 2 h of BFA washout, the number of PIN2-GFP agglomerates in wild-type roots decreased significantly, whereas those in the hlb1 mutant background persisted (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10C</ref>).</p><p>The PIN2 trafficking phenotypes observed in hlb1 were surprisingly opposite to those reported for ben1 but strikingly similar to those described for a class of dominant membrane trafficking mutants called bex (for bfa-visualized exocytic trafficking defective) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feraru et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Tanaka et al., 2014)</ref>. In addition to the persistence of PIN agglomerates after BFA washout, bex1 and bex5 mutants formed intracellular PIN2-GFP agglomerates in response to low (10 mM) concentrations of BFA, whereas the wild type showed only minor agglomerate formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feraru et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Tanaka et al., 2014)</ref>. hlb1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP were therefore treated with 10 mM BFA for 1 and 3 h to determine if hlb1 trafficking defects mirrored those reported for bex1 and bex5. Consistent with previous studies, 10 mM BFA induced only minor intracellular accumulation of PIN2-GFP in wild-type seedlings (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10D</ref>). By contrast, hlb1 roots exposed to 10 mM BFA for the same time periods as the wild type showed significant formation of PIN2-GFP agglomerates that were reminiscent of the bex mutants (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10D</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10E</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feraru et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Tanaka et al., 2014)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recycling of PIN2-GFP to the Plasma Membrane in hlb1 Is Hypersensitive to LatB</head><p>Because hlb1 is hypersensitive to LatB and the actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in the intracellular trafficking of PIN proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Geldner et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nagawa et al., 2012)</ref>, we hypothesized that PIN2-GFP recycling in the hlb1 background could also exhibit heightened sensitivity to concentrations of LatB that only  HLB1 in Functional Homeostasis of the Plant TGN/EE minimally affected PIN2-GFP recycling in the wild type. To test this hypothesis, the wild type and hlb1 expressing PIN2-GFP were treated with 50 nM LatB. At this LatB concentration, PIN2-GFP in roots of the wild type formed a few, weakly fluorescing intracellular PIN2-GFP agglomerates within 1 h of exposure to the drug. On the other hand, roots of hlb1 seedlings formed bright and numerous PIN2-GFP intracellular agglomerates that were reminiscent of BFA-induced PIN2-GFP bodies (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">10F to 10H</ref>). These results indicate that the recycling of PIN2-GFP to the PM in hlb1 is more sensitive to LatB compared with the wild type and consistent with the heightened response of its roots and F-actin structures to the chemical.</p><p>hlb1 Exhibits Enhanced Accumulation of PIN2-GFP at the PM and Endosomes but Has No Measurable Defects in TGN and MIN1/BEN1 Dynamics</p><p>We next asked if the localization of PIN2-GFP was altered in hlb1 root cells without BFA or LatB treatment. Live-cell microscopy and corresponding quantitative analyses showed that PIN2-GFP signal in the hlb1 background was higher in the PM and in the cell interior compared with the wild type when imaged with similar confocal microscopy settings. The stronger fluorescence in the cell interior of hlb1 root cells was due to brighter and more distinct PIN2-GFP foci (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11B</ref>).</p><p>The more intense PIN2-GFP signals in the PM and cell interior of hlb1 roots was reminiscent of observations made in bex5, which showed similar PIN2-GFP recycling defects as hlb1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feraru et al., 2012)</ref>. Given the defects in PIN2-GFP recycling in hlb1, we asked whether the distribution of a TGN/EE marker was altered in the mutant. To address this question, we expressed YFP-VTI12 in the hlb1 background. The distribution of YFP-VTI12 foci in peripheral root cap cells was similar in the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14A</ref>). Furthermore, global analyses of YFP-VTI12 dynamics in root hairs revealed no appreciable differences between the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14C</ref> and Supplemental Movie 12). Because we established that MIN7/BEN1 is an HLB1 interactor at the TGN/EE, we also looked at the distribution of MIN7/ BEN1-GFP in the hlb1 background. Unfortunately, lines expressing MIN7/BEN1-GFP in hlb1 and the wild type were extensively silenced and we could observe GFP signal only from cells in the peripheral root cap. Like YFP-VTI12, the distribution of MIN7/BEN1-GFP in these cells was similar between the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14D</ref>). Although we did not detect any substantial differences between the wild type and hlb1 with regard to VTI12 or MIN7/BEN1 distribution at the light microscope level, we cannot discount the possibility that TGN/EE ultrastructure might be affected in the hlb1 mutant as has been reported in bex5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feraru et al., 2012)</ref>.</p><p>Because conspicuous differences between the wild type and hlb1 were noted with regard to PIN2-GFP intensity in the PM and cell interior (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11B</ref>), we next asked if hlb1 displayed any pin2-like phenotypes in regard to seedling root development. Consistent with previous reports, pin2 seedlings had distinct root agravitropic defects as evident from their high deviation from vertical growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Müller et al., 1998)</ref>. By contrast, the deviation from vertical growth of hlb1 roots was similar to the wild type (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15B</ref>). Moreover, although the deviation from vertical growth of pin2 roots appeared to be enhanced by LatB, their primary roots exhibited wild-type growth sensitivity to LatB (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15D</ref>). Root deviation from vertical growth of ben1 and hlb1 ben1 was similar to hlb1 and the wild type (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15B</ref>).

No measureable differences in root gravitropic response between wild-type and hlb1 seedlings under our growth conditions were noted (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15E</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">15F</ref>).</p></div>

Using spinning-disc confocal microscopy, we found that growing root hairs of the wild type had intense SEC-RFP fluorescence at the extreme tip.

The tip-focused SEC-RFP gradient was quantified by obtaining the ratio of the average SEC-RFP fluorescence at the tip apex to the average SEC-RFP fluorescence at the subapex from 1-min time-lapse movie sequences (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11D</ref>). We found that ratio values at every 10-s time point were higher in the wild type compared with hlb1, verifying our visual observations that secretion in root hair tips of hlb1 is altered (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11E</ref>). Furthermore, retention of SEC-RFP in the ER appeared to be more pronounced in hlb1 cotyledons compared with the wild type (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11F</ref>). However, like in the wild type, strong SEC-RFP fluorescence was still observed in the apoplast of various cell types of hlb1 seedlings (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11F</ref>; Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16A to 16D</ref>). Taken together, our results indicate that bulk flow secretion in hlb1 is only partially affected, a defect that is most strongly manifested in growing root hairs, which have measurable F-actin defects.</p><p>The localization of HLB1 to the TGN/EE suggests that other post-Golgi trafficking pathways such as trafficking to the vacuole might be affected in the hlb1 mutant. To address this question, we expressed RFP-AFVY, a fusion to the C-terminal of phaseolin that accumulates in the vacuole lumen <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Hunter et al., 2007)</ref>. Because RFP-AFVY was strongly silenced in root cells, we focused our analyses on hypocotyls and cotyledons. We found that RFP-AFVY in hypocotyl and cotyledon epidermal cells of hlb1 seedlings appeared to be mis-sorted to the apoplast (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11G</ref>). Missorting of RFP-AFVY was quantified by obtaining the ratio of fluorescence from a fixed region of the apoplast to an equivalent area within the vacuole lumen in epidermal cells of the hypocotyl (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11G</ref>). The higher ratio values for hlb1 compared with the wild type support that RFP-AFVY is mis-sorted in the mutant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11H</ref>). However, RFP-AFVY still accumulated in the vacuole lumen of several cell types in hlb1 similar to the wild type, indicating that vacuolar targeting defects in the mutant are only partial (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">11G</ref>).</p><p>Other evidence showing that trafficking to the vacuole in hlb1 is not completely compromised was obtained from incubating wild-type and hlb1 seedlings expressing PIN2-GFP in the dark for 12 h. Under such conditions, PIN2-GFP in the wild type was shown to accumulate in lytic vacuoles <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feraru et al., 2012)</ref>. Here, we observed that both the wild type and hlb1 accumulated PIN2-GFP in lytic vacuoles in the dark (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16E</ref>). In addition, the styryl dye FM1-43 labeled the tonoplast in elongating root cells of light-grown hlb1 seedlings, indicating that trafficking to the vacuole can still proceed in the mutant. FM1-43 labeling of root cells in the elongation zone and DIC microscopy of peripheral root cap cells also did not reveal dramatic differences in vacuolar morphology between the wild type and hlb1 (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16F</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">16G</ref>). However, the possibility that there are subtle differences in vacuolar dynamics and morphology between the wild type and hlb1 cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, differences in vacuole morphology between the wild type and hlb1 could be more apparent in other cell types or amplified under certain growth conditions (e.g., light versus dark).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic Interaction Studies Indicate that hlb1 and ben1 Function in Common Root Developmental Pathways despite Opposite Effects on Membrane Trafficking</head><p>As noted above, it was previously shown that ben1 had reduced intracellular accumulation of PIN-GFP following treatment with 50 mM BFA, a phenotype opposite to that of hlb1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Tanaka et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Tanaka et al., , 2013))</ref>. The opposite trafficking phenotypes of ben1 and hlb1 were surprising given their similar root developmental phenotypes and LatB hypersensitivity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">9</ref>). To better understand the genetic relationship between hlb1 and ben1, hlb1 ben1 double mutants were generated and their phenotypes were compared with hlb1 and ben1 single mutants. The extent of hypersensitivity of hlb1 ben1 double mutants to LatB was similar to single hlb1 and ben1 mutants (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13A</ref>). Furthermore, root hair length of hlb1 ben1 in the absence of LatB was slightly shorter than hlb1 single mutants but similar to ben1 single mutants. In addition, hlb1 ben1 had slightly shorter primary roots in LatB-free media compared with hlb1 and ben1 single mutants (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13B to 13D</ref>).</p><p>We next asked how trafficking of PM markers is affected in hlb1 ben1 double mutants compared with hlb1 and ben1 single mutants. For these assays, we used the endocytic styryl tracer dye FM1-43. Consistent with the PIN2-GFP assays, FM1-43 in the wild type and hlb1 formed fluorescent agglomerates after a 1-h treatment with 50 mM BFA (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12B</ref>). Also in agreement with the PIN2-GFP assays was the observation that FM1-43 agglomerates persisted in hlb1 compared with the wild type after BFA washout (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">17</ref>). By contrast, ben1 had diminished accumulation of FM1-43 agglomerates after BFA treatment, in agreement with previous reports (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12C</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Tanaka et al., 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">(Tanaka et al., , 2013))</ref>. In hlb1 ben1, FM1-43 accumulation was diminished to a similar extent as ben1 single mutants (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12D</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12E</ref>). The similar LatB-hypersensitive response and root growth defects of hlb1 ben1 to single hlb1 and ben1 mutants indicate that hlb1 and ben1 function in common genetic pathways. Because hlb1 ben1 trafficking and root hair defects mirrored those of the ben1 single mutant, ben1 likely functions upstream of hlb1.</p><p>Another phenotype reported for ben1 seedlings is their hypersensitivity to growth on moderate concentrations of BFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b101">(Tanaka et al., 2009)</ref>. Given that both ben1 and hlb1 phenocopied each other in regard to root development and hypersensitivity to LatB, the response of hlb1 to BFA was examined. Consistent with previous reports, ben1 seedlings displayed heightened sensitivity to low doses of BFA compared with the wild type. By contrast, hlb1 seedlings showed wild-type sensitivity to BFA. Furthermore, seedlings of the hlb1 ben1 double mutant displayed similar hypersensitivity to BFA compared to seedlings of ben1 single mutants, providing additional genetic evidence that ben1 functions upstream of hlb1 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12F</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_17">12G</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The endomembrane system is essential for normal plant cell development, yet many protein components that modulate its function remain to be identified. The distinct effects of cytoskeletondisrupting chemicals on plant growth provide the basis for convenient forward-genetic screens to isolate mutants with altered sensitivity to these compounds. However, such screens have rarely been applied for studies on the plant cytoskeleton despite their strong potential to uncover mechanisms underlying the cytoskeletal basis of plant development. Forward-genetic screens to isolate mutants that respond differentially to cytoskeleton-disrupting compounds have been limited to those that alter microtubules <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Naoi and Hashimoto, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Paredez et al., 2008)</ref>. Here, we used a forwardgenetic approach with the potent actin-disrupting compound LatB and identified the recessive mutant hlb1, which displayed enhanced LatB sensitivity compared with the wild type. We determined that HLB1 encodes a six TPR motif-containing protein with a conserved C-terminal domain. We found that HLB1 is a plant-specific protein that could potentially link the actin cytoskeleton with post-Golgi traffic. Loss of function of HLB1 leads to alterations in protein recycling to the PM and to an F-actin network that is more susceptible to actin-specific chemical antagonists. This, in turn, results in seedlings with root hair polarity defects and reduced primary root growth. We demonstrated that HLB1 associates with the TGN/EE through its conserved C-terminal domain and functions with the TGN/EE-localized ARF-GEF protein MIN7/BEN1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Nomura et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Tanaka et al., 2009)</ref> in overlapping endomembrane trafficking pathways. These data provide important insight into a previously undescribed component of the endomembrane trafficking machinery that is highly conserved and unique to land plants.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HLB1 Is a Component of the Plant Post-Golgi Trafficking Machinery</head><p>Our work experimentally demonstrates that a TPR domain protein, namely, HLB1, is localized to post-Golgi compartments. Other TPR domain-containing proteins among the 147 in Arabidopsis, including SHORT AND SWOLLEN ROOT1 and MET1, localize to mitochondria and chloroplasts, respectively, consistent with their functions in oxidative stress-mediated root development and in the assembly of the photosynthetic apparatus <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bhuiyan et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b118">Zhang et al., 2015)</ref>. The TPR protein CLUMPED CHLOROPLAST1 (CLMP1) localizes to distinct foci in the cytoplasm. Although the exact identity of the CLMP1 foci remains unknown, their adjacent location to chloroplasts supports their role in plastid partitioning and distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b114">(Yang et al., 2011)</ref>. Here, we show that the TGN/EE-localized HLB1 protein functions in the recycling of proteins and other lipophilic cargo from post-Golgi compartments to the PM after their uptake by endocytosis. This conclusion is supported by the observation that BFAinduced PIN2-GFP and FM1-43 agglomerates persisted in hlb1 mutants after BFA washout.</p><p>hlb1 also had partial defects in constitutive secretion, which were most apparent in cells of young seedlings including root hairs and epidermal pavement cells of cotyledons. In this regard, LatB treatment was previously shown to alter the tip localization of the TGN-localized secretory marker YFP-RabA4B in growing root hairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Preuss et al., 2004)</ref>. The disrupted gradient of F-actin meshwork in hlb1 root hairs could explain the tip secretion and root hair growth defects of the mutant. The mis-sorting of RFP-AFVY to the apoplast of hlb1 is reminiscent of another post-Golgi trafficking mutant called unhinged-1, which is disrupted in a gene encoding VASCULAR SORTING PROTEIN51 <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Pahari et al., 2014)</ref>. Mis-sorting of RFP-AFVY was only partial as the marker still accumulated to a large extent in the vacuole lumen of hlb1. The RFP-AFVY assays were verified by observations that PIN2-GFP accumulated in lytic vacuoles when incubated in the dark and that FM1-43 decorated the tonoplast in hlb1. Future studies will determine whether other markers of vacuolar targeting and morphology are altered in hlb1.</p><p>In animals, some TPR domain proteins localize to the endomembrane system. For instance, the endosome-localized sorting nexins SNX20 and SNX21 contain TPR motifs in addition to their phox homology (PX) phosphoinositide binding domain. These sorting nexins have been proposed to function as membraneassociated scaffolding proteins that could potentially interact with transmembrane ligands for transport through the endomembrane system <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Clairfeuille et al., 2015)</ref>. In addition to the TPR motifs, HLB1 contains a C-terminal domain that is highly conserved among land plants. Protein domain prediction software indicates that this C-terminal domain can form a helical structure and manual annotation revealed that it had weak similarity (;15%) to the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Arabidopsis PLECKSTRIN HOMOLOG1.LikePX domains, PHdomainsbindto phosphoinositides and could facilitate targeting of proteins containing these domains  to membranes <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Boss and Im, 2012)</ref>. Consistent with the possibility that the C-terminal domain of HLB1 has similar functions to canonical PX or PH domains, we showed through GFP-HLB1 deletion constructs that HLB1 localized to TGN/EE compartments primarily through its C-terminal domain. Although direct binding of the HLB1 to lipids has yet to be demonstrated, the root hair defects of hlb1 suggest that the HLB1 C-terminal domain could provide a mechanism for integrating phosphoinositide signaling with actin-mediated tip growth regulation. In this regard, phosphoinositides have been implicated in actin-mediated root hair tip growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Vincent et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b115">Yoo et al., 2012)</ref> and mutants disrupted in various steps of phosphoinositide metabolism have altered root hair development <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Kusano et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Stenzel et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">Thole et al., 2008)</ref> that mirrors the root hair phenotypes of hlb1. One explanation for the root hair defects of the hlb1 mutant is that HLB1 functions in recycling of phosphoinositide metabolizing enzymes or phosphoinositides to the PM of the root hair apex. Future studies will test this hypothesis using fluorescently tagged phosphoinositide reporters and enzymes.</p><p>The trafficking defects of hlb1 were similar to the previously characterized dominant bex1 and bex5 mutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feraru et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Tanaka et al., 2014)</ref>. In this regard, we speculate that BEX1, an ARF1A1C small GTPase, and BEX5, a RABA1b small GTPase, could functionally converge onto similar trafficking pathways mediated by HLB1. It is important to note, however, that despite the similarities in membrane trafficking phenotypes of hlb1 to those of the bex mutants, they differed in their seedling sensitivity to BFA. Whereas bex1 and bex5 seedling growth was reported to be hypersensitive to moderate BFA concentrations <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feraru et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b103">Tanaka et al., 2014)</ref>, hlb1 seedlings showed wild-type BFA sensitivity. T-DNA knockout bex5 mutants did not show the trafficking defects characteristic of the dominant-negative bex5-1, suggesting functional redundancy with other closely related RABA1b GTPases <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Feraru et al., 2012)</ref>. In the future, it will be interesting to test how bex loss-of-function mutants respond to LatB and to determine whether ARF1A1C and RABA1b operate in common exocytic trafficking pathways as HLB1. Although HLB1 is encoded by a single Arabidopsis gene and the hlb1 mutant showed clear defects in exocytosis and heightened sensitivity to LatB, the mild root phenotypes of hlb1 in the absence of LatB suggests that HLB1 could function redundantly with other unknown nonhomologous proteins in plant development.</p><p>A significant finding from our study is the identification of MIN7/ BEN1, a TGN/EE-localized ARF-GEF protein belonging to the BIG subfamily <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Nomura et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b101">Tanaka et al., 2009)</ref>, as an HLB1 interactor. Although the nature of the HLB1-MIN7/BEN1 interaction at the biochemical level has yet to be established, results presented here point to HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 operating in converging endomembrane trafficking pathways. In addition to the clear colocalization of HLB1 and MIN7/BEN1 in distinct TGN/ EE foci, double mutant studies demonstrate that ben1 is epistatic to hlb1 with regard to LatB hypersensitivity, FM1-43 recycling, root hair growth, and sensitivity to moderate concentrations of BFA. Because the hlb1 ben1 double mutant most closely resembles the phenotypes of the ben1 single mutant, MIN7/BEN1 likely functions upstream of HLB1. This observation reinforces the conclusion that the hlb1 mutant is deficient specifically in endocytic membrane recycling. The epistatic effect of ben1 on hlb1 with respect to the formation of FM1-43 BFA bodies suggests that in hlb1, the pool of PM-derived cargo for TGN-regulated recycling likely originates from endocytic uptake mediated by BEN1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>HLB1 Potentially Links Post-Golgi Traffic to the Actin Cytoskeleton in Plants</head><p>In addition to the root hair tip growth defects and strong hypersensitivity of hlb1 seedlings to LatB, our results support the possibility that HLB1 may exert its functions in endomembrane traffic through actin. This is supported by several lines of evidence. First, confocal microscopy analyses showed that the HLB1-GFP bodies tracked along F-actin bundles in vivo. HLB1-GFP localization was reminiscent of the "beads-on-a-string" pattern exhibited by the NET family of actin membrane adaptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">(Wang et al., 2014)</ref>. Second, the localization of the HLB1-GFP foci was rapidly disrupted by low doses of LatB. Third, PIN2-GFP recycling to the PM, which was only minimally affected by low doses of LatB in the wild type, was severely inhibited in hlb1. The LatB-induced PIN2-GFP agglomerates were strikingly similar to those induced by high concentrations of BFA. Despite these results, we cannot discard the possibility that the movement of HLB1-GFP punctae along F-actin could simply reflect that HLB1 is on the TGN/EE surface, which would not support specific functional linkage between actin and HLB1. Furthermore, we have found that LatB also rapidly affected the distribution of other TGN/EE markers in root cells, indicating that the observed effects of the drug on HLB1 localization are not exclusive for this protein. Nonetheless, we showed that actin dynamics in the tip of elongating root hairs are disrupted in hlb1 in support of the notion that HLB1 could be linked to actin function. The lack of differences in F-actin organization and dynamics in cells of the root elongation zone between non-LatBtreated wild type and hlb1 does not preclude the possibility that subtle differences in F-actin dynamics exist between the wild type and hlb1, and such differences may manifest only at the level of single actin filaments <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">(Staiger et al., 2009)</ref>. While a direct interaction between HLB1 with actin awaits for experimental validation, our analyses support that HLB1 exerts a role in post-Golgi membrane traffic in relation to the actin cytoskeleton, which may occur either directly or through interactions with actin modulators.</p><p>The involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis and protein recycling has been documented in plants using both pharmacological and genetic approaches. For example, sterol endocytosis was found to be disrupted in act2 mutants and by treating wild-type plants with cytochalasin D <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Grebe et al., 2003)</ref>. LatB and cytochalasin were also shown to influence the recycling and polar localization of PIN proteins in root and leaf epidermal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Geldner et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Nagawa et al., 2012)</ref>. Finally, LatB was reported to interfere with protein traffic to the vacuole in protoplasts and intact roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Kim et al., 2005)</ref>. It is important to note, however, that in the aforementioned studies, high micromolar concentrations of LatB were used to trigger the reported effects on protein trafficking. The fact that hlb1 displayed strong protein trafficking and seedling growth defects in response to low nanomolar doses of LatB supports the hypothesis that HLB1 is a crucial component of post-Golgi traffic that is strongly dependent on the maintenance of an intact actin cytoskeleton. This hypothesis is further reinforced by the observation that heightened sensitivity to LatB was more pronounced in hlb1 and ben1 mutants compared with mutants with lesions in genes encoding actin itself (e.g., act2 and act8) or mutants to a suite of other actin regulatory proteins, most of which were not LatB hypersensitive. In this regard, another possible explanation for the hypersensitivity of hlb1 mutants to LatB is that loss of function of HLB1 causes mild recycling defects of several proteins directly involved in actin function particularly those that localized to the PM. The collective recycling defects of several PM-localized actin regulatory proteins, although mild, could sensitize hlb1 to even low doses of actin antagonists.</p><p>Despite the recycling defects of PIN2-GFP in the hlb1 background, hlb1 did not exhibit the agravitropic phenotype characteristic of pin2 mutants and were not compromised in root gravitropism when reoriented by 90 degrees. The absence of any measurable pin2-like phenotypes in hlb1, ben1, and hlb1 ben1 double mutants supports that the protein recycling defects resulting from loss of HLB1 and BEN1 function may not be sufficient to completely alter certain PIN2-mediated seedling root growth processes. This observation further reinforces the hypothesis that HLB1 and BEN1 function redundantly with other yet to be identified TGN/EE-localized proteins in cargo recycling. The possibility that HLB1 has redundant functions with other nonhomologous proteins can also be inferred from the lack of global defects in VTI12 and MIN7/BEN1 distribution in the hlb1 mutant. Alternatively, MIN7/BEN1 could recruit HLB1 to the TGN/EE explaining the lack of any dramatic differences in MIN7/BEN1-GFP distribution between the wild type and hlb1. By contrast, root gravitropism has been shown to be driven by differential degradation of PIN2 in the vacuole of cells in the elongation zone and PIN3 relocalization to the bottom side of the columella cell PM <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Kleine-Vehn et al., 2008</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">, 2010)</ref>. The lack of root gravitropism defects in hlb1 is consistent with the observation that loss of HLB1 function has only mild effects on vacuolar trafficking and suggests that HLB1-mediated PIN2 recycling to the PM has minimal contributions to root gravitropic responses. The normal root gravity response of hlb1 also indicates that unlike PIN2, recycling of PIN3 and possibly other PIN proteins is independent of HLB1 function. However, additional experiments are needed to determine whether the trafficking of other PIN or PM-localized proteins is affected in the hlb1 mutant.</p><p>In summary, a forward-genetic screen for altered sensitivity to the actin-disrupting drug LatB led to the discovery of a previously uncharacterized protein involved in endomembrane trafficking in plants. The TPR domain-containing HLB1 protein, which is encoded by a single gene in Arabidopsis, functions in protein recycling to the PM but could also contribute to constitutive secretion and trafficking to the vacuole in specific cell types. The shared phenotypes of hlb1 with other exocytic and endocytic trafficking mutants such as ben1, bex1, and bex5 indicate that the TGN/EE-localized HLB1 protein lies at a crucial step where exocytic and endocytic pathways converge and therefore represent a class of plant-specific membrane scaffolding proteins likely involved in linking post-Golgi traffic with the actin cytoskeleton.</p></div>

To generate the GFP-HLB1 ΔCTD fusion, a truncated HLB1 cDNA fragment, from position 1 to 1482 bp, was amplified using the primers HLB1-F-NcoI and HLB1 ΔCTD -R-SpeI (59-TACACTAGTTTA-TACCGTCTTCCTCTCCACGT-39), and the resulting product was digested with NcoI and SpeI (New England Biolabs) and cloned into a modified pCAMBIA1390 vector. Similarly, the GFP-HLB1 ΔTPR fusion was created by first amplifying HLB1 cDNA from position 1 to 609 bp with the following primers: HLB1 ΔTPR -F-NcoI (59-CATCCATGGTAATGGCGGATACTGTTGAA-GAG-39) and HLB1 ΔTPR -R-SpeI (59-TACACTAGTACGTTGGCGAGATCGACC-39).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Image Analysis</head><p>Percentage of occupancy of F-actin was determined using the algorithm described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Higaki et al. (2010)</ref>. Prior to applying the Higaki algorithm, single cells from the root elongation zone were converted into binary images and filaments skeletonized by software that was developed using MATLAB R2013a (The Mathworks Inc.) as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Dyachok et al., 2014)</ref>. Intensity of BFA agglomerates was obtained using custom software written in MATLAB 8.5. The original images from the confocal microscope were first converted to gray scale and separated into 48 layers by intensity values from zero to maximum (255*255), and a binary image was created. The circle Hough Transform method was used to trace areas occupied by BFA-and LatB-induced PIN2-GFP or FM1-43 agglomerates in the binary images. The average intensity in grayscale images in each of marked agglomerate was calculated. From the same set of images used to calculate agglomerate fluorescence intensity, the number of agglomerates per cell was manually counted.</p><p>Quantification and statistical analyses of global F-actin and YFP-VTI12 dynamics were conducted following the methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b107">Vidali et al. (2010)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Dyachok et al. (2014)</ref> using images of root epidermal cells and root hairs from at least 15 time-lapse movie sequences. To adopt the method used for global analysis of F-actin to dynamics of YFP-VTI12 foci in root hairs, we first created an algorithm that utilized the Hough Transform method to detect individual organelles from binary images obtained from time-lapse movies. This algorithm allowed us to set a threshold so that fluorescence originating from the cytoplasm was excluded from our analysis.</p><p>To quantify fluorescence in the PM and cell interior of PIN2-GFPexpressing root cells, we created another algorithm. After converting images to gray scale, binary images were generated after separating the image into 48 layers and classifying the layers based on their intensity values. This allowed us to separate fluorescence of the PM from the cell interior where the white area in the binary image corresponded to PM signals and the black area corresponded to the cell interior. Fluorescence intensity was calculated by accumulating the intensity value of each pixel from the PM and cell interior.</p><p>To quantify the extent of colocalization between HLB1-GFP and other mCherry-tagged TGN/EE markers, spinning-disc confocal images were first thresholded using the Volocity quantitation software (Perkin-Elmer). The colocalization function of Volocity allows automated thresholding and statistical analyses of red and green channels according to the methods of <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Manders et al. (1993)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Costes et al. (2004)</ref>. From the colocalization menu of Volocity quantitation, a region of interest representing a single cell (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7A</ref>) was selected, and from generated scatterplots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7F</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bottanelli et al., 2012)</ref>, Pearson's correlation coefficient values were calculated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The Plant Cell were aligned by MUSCLE algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Edgar, 2004)</ref>, and unreliable sequences with confidence score lower than 0.6 were removed <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Penn et al., 2010)</ref>. The alignment is available as Supplemental Data Set 3. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses were conducted in MEGA6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Tamura et al., 2013)</ref> based on the maximum likelihood method <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Le and Gascuel, 2008)</ref>. A matrix of pairwise distances was estimated by the JTT model, and the tree with the highest log likelihood (12,977) was chosen with the Neighbor-join and BIONJ algorithm. A discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (+G, parameter = 3.2081). All positions with &lt;95% site coverage were eliminated.</p><p>To find TPR-containing proteins, the Arabidopsis genome was scanned with TPRpred <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Karpenahalli et al., 2007)</ref>. The resulting 587 proteins were compared against the Conserved Domain Database <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Marchler-Bauer et al., 2015)</ref>. The 147 Arabidopsis proteins were identified to have more than one TPR motifs. Predicated subcellular localization for the TPR proteins was obtained from the SubCellular Proteome Database and presented in Supplemental Data Set 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Co-IP</head><p>Co-IP experiments were conducted using the Pierce Classic IP kit (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, proteins were extracted by grinding roots of 2-week-old Arabidopsis seedlings expressing 35Spro:GFP, 35Spro:GFP-HLB, and 35Spro:MIN7/BEN1-GFP in liquid nitrogen. The fine powder was then mixed with extraction/wash solution supplemented with 1:100 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) by vortexing. The protein extracts were centrifuged at 16,000g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was mixed with control resin via end-over-end shaking in a 15-mL Falcon tube for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was then added to a spin column and centrifuged at 1000g for 30 s at 4°C. Rabbit Anti-GFP Monoclonal Antibody (ABCAM catalog number1218, lot number GR181836-3) was added to the cleared protein lysate and mixed by end-over-end shaking overnight at 4°C. Protein A/G plus agarose resin was then added and allowed to mix for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was again added to a spin column and centrifuged at 1000g for 30 s at 4°C. The columns were washed five times with extraction/wash solution and then one time with 13 conditioning buffer. The proteins were eluted by adding 23 nonreducing lane marker sample buffer with 20 mM DTT and heating for 10 min at 100°C. Once cooled, the columns were placed inside Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 1000g for 30 s at 4°C. Composition of the eluent was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (Bioproximity). Briefly, the samples were digested with trypsin (10 mg/mL) overnight at 37°C. The resulting peptides were dried and redissolved in 50% acetonitrile with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were resolved with Thermo Easy-nLC1000 column (C18 reverse phase, 50 cm, f 75 mm), ionized with Thermo Easy Spray,andthen analyzed with a Thermo Q-exactive quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer. The spectra were assigned to peptides using the OMSSA <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Geer et al., 2004)</ref>, X!Tandem <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Craig and Beavis, 2004)</ref>, and X!
