<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The ability to grow safe, fresh food to supplement packaged foods of astronauts in space has been an important goal for NASA. Food crops grown in space experience different environmental conditions than plants grown on Earth (e.g., reduced gravity, elevated radiation levels). To study the effects of space conditions, red romaine lettuce, Lactuca sativa cv 'Outredgeous,' plants were grown in Veggie plant growth chambers on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared with ground-grown plants. Multiple plantings were grown on ISS and harvested using either a single, final harvest, or sequential harvests in which several mature leaves were removed from the plants at weekly intervals. Ground controls were grown simultaneously with a 24-72 h delay using ISS environmental data. Food safety of the plants was determined by heterotrophic plate counts for bacteria and fungi, as well as isolate identification using samples taken from the leaves and roots. Molecular characterization was conducted using Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to provide taxonomic composition and phylogenetic structure of the community. Leaves were also analyzed for elemental composition, as well as levels of phenolics, anthocyanins, and Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC). Comparison of flight and ground tissues showed some differences in total counts for bacteria and yeast/molds (2.14 -4.86 log 10 CFU/g), while screening for select human pathogens yielded negative results. Bacterial and fungal isolate identification and community characterization indicated variation in the diversity of genera between leaf and root tissue with diversity being higher in root tissue, and included differences in the dominant genera. The only difference between ground and flight experiments was seen in the third experiment, VEG-03A, with significant differences in the genera from leaf tissue. Flight and ground tissue showed differences in Fe, K, Na, P, S, and Zn content and total phenolic levels, but no differences in anthocyanin and ORAC levels. This study indicated that leafy vegetable crops can produce safe, edible, fresh food to supplement to the astronauts' diet, and provide baseline data for continual operation of the Veggie plant growth units on ISS.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Crop production in space may be a necessary and desirable component of future exploration systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(MacElroy et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Kliss et al., 2000)</ref>. Fresh produce can be grown in situ to supplement a stored, packaged diet, and crops may provide beneficial nutrients as well as dietary variety. Veggie is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by Orbital Technologies Corporation (Now Sierra Nevada Corp., Madison, WI, United States) to grow vegetable crops in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Morrow et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Morrow and Remiker, 2009)</ref>.</p><p>The first Veggie plant growth chamber was launched to the International Space Station (ISS) in April, 2014 along with eighteen plant (rooting) pillows for the VEG-01 experiment. Veggie is a simple plant growth facility that uses LED lights and fans to circulate ISS air through the plant growth volume. A transparent, extensible bellows attached to the light unit via magnets contains the growing plants and any debris, and directs air flow from the bottom of the canopy to the top of the growth volume (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Screens remove large particles from the cabin air before it passes through the plant growth chamber, however, no level of filtration is present, so plants growing in Veggie are exposed to any microbial or chemical constituents present in the ISS environment. More details about the Veggie facility can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Massa et al. (2016)</ref>. For the VEG-01 and VEG-03 demonstration tests, plants were grown from seeds in plant pillows. Plant pillows are small growing bags that interact with a root mat water reservoir on the Veggie baseplate. Pillows contain a calcined clay substrate mixed with controlled release fertilizer and wicks for seed attachment. Surface sanitized seeds are glued into these plant pillow wicks, and pillows are packaged for flight under sterile air. Further details of seed and pillow preparation are provided by <ref type="bibr">Massa et al. (2017b)</ref>.</p><p>A major focus of our research in the past several years has been to identify crop candidates with high potential for dietary supplementation, given the constraints associated with the current space diet. Ongoing testing has indicated that some essential human nutrients are either deficient in the processed and pre-packaged space foods (e.g., potassium, Vitamin K) or may degrade to inadequate levels over the times required for long duration missions (e.g., Vitamin B1, Vitamin C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cooper, 2013)</ref>. Several of these nutrients may be supplemented through fresh salad crops and will provide antioxidants and phytochemicals in a natural, whole-food form. Previous studies with salad crops have focused on combinations of environmental conditions (e.g., light, temperature, CO 2 concentration) needed to optimize plant growth for space settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Richards et al., 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Richards et al., , 2006))</ref>. While the macro nutritional value of crops was often evaluated in productivity studies (calories, protein, fats, and carbohydrates), micro nutritional data are limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(McKeehen et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Wheeler et al., 1996</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Wheeler et al., , 1997))</ref>. In order to utilize "pick-and-eat" produce such as the lettuce crops grown in VEG-01 and 03 as a supplemental food for space, nutritional assessment is essential. In this study we compare the nutritional quality of red romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa, cv. Outredgeous) grown on ISS to ground controls grown under the same ISS environmental conditions including relative humidity, CO 2 concentration and temperature. Within a Veggie chamber, conditions such as humidity and temperature can vary from ISS conditions outside the chamber, for example, the temperature and humidity inside the Veggie tend to be slightly elevated compared to the open cabin air. These differences may have an impact on the elemental, nutritional and microbiological components of the plant. Increased temperatures have been shown to decrease macronutrient content in red leaf lettuce while increasing flavonoids and phenolics <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Sublett et al., 2018)</ref>. Studies have shown that increased humidity initiates a positive response in biomass yield in many agricultural crops while concomitantly decreasing transpiration rate altering the uptake of water and some nutrients <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Tibbitts, 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Gislerød and Mortensen, 1990)</ref>.</p><p>Microbiological testing is an integral part of any food safety program to verify quality, production and proper handling processes but few studies exist for space grown plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hummerick et al., 2010)</ref>. We conducted microbiological testing of Veggie-grown produce to understand potential risks to astronauts as consumers. Good agricultural practices and procedures are in place to minimize microbial contamination of crops grown in Veggie, and microbial testing is one tool to verify the effectiveness of these processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hummerick et al., 2011)</ref>. Plant-growth conditions, the surrounding environment, mineral nutrition, and plant species can all influence the microbial populations living on plant surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lindow and Brandl, 2003)</ref>. A variety of microorganisms can be found on fresh produce, most as part of the normal flora of the plant with no adverse effect on humans if consumed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Heaton and Jones, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Leff and Fierer, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Oyinlola et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Microbiological analysis can also provide insight on the microbial ecology (population density and types of bacteria and fungi) of Veggie-grown plants. The likelihood of contamination and growth of potential human pathogens on plants grown in Veggie is low since sterilization/sanitization of seeds, plant growth medium, irrigation water, and hardware can be controlled. However, if a contamination event were to occur, the risks to the crew of exposure to food borne pathogens could be increased considering the association of immune dysregulation to spaceflight <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Borchers et al., 2002)</ref>. Heterotrophic bacterial counts and the presence of Enterobacteriaceae that serve as an indicator of contamination of processed foods, irrigation water, and food processing surfaces are frequently present in raw foods like fresh produce making those tests irrelevant as risk indicators for fruits and vegetables <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Heaton and Jones, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Leff and Fierer, 2013)</ref>. The microbial load on crops intended for consumption by astronauts presumably should fall within an acceptable range of microbiological standards set for food. Currently, however, there are no standards in place for microbial levels in fresh produce grown in space. The closest related NASA standards are for nonthermostabilized food items including any of the freeze dried foods consumed in orbit, e.g., shrimp cocktail, chocolate candy, granola bars. For example, the current limit for aerobic bacteria on a non-thermostabilized food item is &lt;2 × 10 4 colony-forming units (CFU) per gram on one sample or &lt;1 × 10 4 on two out of five samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Perchonok et al., 2012)</ref> however, these standards apply to prepackaged food sent from Earth. For fresh produce grown on ISS, the microbiological acceptability is assessed on a case-by-case basis relying on microbiological analysis of crops grown in ground studies analogous to Veggie grown crops. Microbiological analysis has been performed previously on edible plants grown in the Russian Lada chamber on ISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hummerick et al., 2010</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hummerick et al., , 2011))</ref>. Mizuna, barley and radish from Lada were stored at -80 • C after harvest until analysis was performed at Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States. A range of microbial densities as indicated by aerobic bacterial and fungal plate counts was found depending on plant type and location. The four samples of mizuna, the only leafy green tested, were grown in different Lada root modules at different times and counts ranged from 3.1 × 10 3 -8.7 × 10 5 . When compared to field grown or market produce of similar types these numbers are well within the expected range of microbial densities or even lower <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Holvoet et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Wood et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Fröhling et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Hummerick et al., unpublished data)</ref>.</p><p>However, not all microorganisms can be cultured in the laboratory and alternate methods of community characterization are needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Byrd et al., 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Schaule et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Kalmbach et al., 1997)</ref>. Genomic DNA analysis using whole genome or amplicon sequencing provides the capability of identifying 98-99% of the microbes present in a complex, heterogeneous microbial community. With the current advances in technology, the Illumina MiSeq provided a platform for capturing the community structure of the leaf and root material returned from the ISS and for the ground control samples. Identifying the community makeup is the first step in understanding the complex structure and interactions between mutualistic or symbiotic partners in plant growth systems.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ISS and Veggie environmental conditions on the microbiological and nutritional quality of Veggie grown lettuce intended for crew consumption.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Plant Growth and Harvest</head><p>The Veggie production system on ISS is a small plant growth chamber designed and built by ORBITEC (Madison, WI, United States) to grow crops in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Morrow et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Morrow and Remiker, 2009)</ref>. The Veggie production system, equipped with LED lighting and a passive watering system, launched to the ISS in 2014 aboard Space X's third Commercial Resupply (CRS-3) mission (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Red romaine lettuce Lactuca sativa cv. 'Outredgeous' was grown in Veggie rooting pillows as described by <ref type="bibr">Massa et al. (2017a)</ref>. Briefly, plants were grown in Veggie pillows containing solid, porous, arcillite (calcined clay) substrate in two different blends, either 100% sized to 600 µ-1 mm or a 1:1 ratio of that size to 1-2 mm (Turface Proleague, Profile Products, LLC) and controlled release fertilizer (Nutricote 18-6-8, type 180, Florikan, Sarasota, FL, United States). Procedures for detailed substrate and pillow preparation are outlined in <ref type="bibr">Massa et al. (2017b)</ref>. Two surface sanitized seeds were attached with guar in each plant pillow between paired germination wicks. All plant rooting pillows with attached seeds were kept dry in heat sealed, gas-impermeable Tedlar bags until test initiation on the ISS. Seeds for three separate, independent plantings (biological replicates) were germinated and grown for 33-56 days on ISS and ground controls were run in controlled environment chambers under ISS environmental conditions with a 24 h delay for VEG-01A and B and a 72 h delay for VEG-03A. Each experiment began with six rooting pillows. Germinated seeds were thinned to one plant per pillow at day 7. Each independent planting was grown at different times aboard ISS with parallel ground experiments for comparison (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>VEG-01A was grown from May 8 to June 10, 2014; VEG-01B was grown from July 8 to August 10, 2015, and VEG-03A</p><p>TABLE 1 | Initiation and harvest schedule of red romaine lettuce crop in Veggie aboard ISS.</p><p>was grown from October 25 to December 28, 2016. VEG-01A and B were harvested after 33 days of growth using sanitized scissors to remove the leaves (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). VEG-03A leaves were harvested sequentially starting at 33 days followed by 3 weekly harvests. Harvested leaves from each plant were wrapped in foil and placed into a -80 • C freezer. The first, third, and half of the fourth harvests were consumed by the crew. Only the 2nd harvest and the remaining leaves (approximately half of the total leaves) of the final harvest from VEG-03A were stored for sample return. After completion of the final harvest for all three plantings, two rooting pillows from each independent experiment were removed from Veggie hardware and placed into bags and frozen at -80 • C. Ground control samples were processed and stored the same as flight samples. The Veggie baseplate was positioned 30.5-31.75 cm below the LED light array to provide approximately 200 µmol•m 2</p><p>•s -1 of photosynthetically active radiation at the surface of the pillows in the center of the Veggie unit at a ratio of 12 red (630 nm): 3 Blue (455 nm): 1 green (530 nm). A photoperiod was set to 16 h light/8 h dark. Environmental conditions from the three experiments are summarized in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>. Both the VEG-01A and part of the VEG-03A experiment on ISS had data collected inside the Veggie chamber using a temperature and relative humidity data logger.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Processing</head><p>After return to Kennedy Space Center, Merritt Island, FL, United States samples from all three experiments were maintained in a -80 • C freezer until analysis. Plant samples were removed from the freezer and processed immediately while pillows were thawed at 4 • C overnight. Leaf biomass was divided for microbiological and chemical analysis. The samples intended for chemical analysis were subsequently frozen at -80 • C, freeze dried, then ground up using an IKA Tekmar A10 Analytical Grinding Mill. Roots were removed from each pillow and divided for microbiological and molecular analysis.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microbiological Analysis</head><p>Leaf and pillow root samples were placed into sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with glass beads, weighed then shaken vigorously for 2 min. Sample extracts were diluted into PBS and appropriate dilutions were plated in duplicate onto trypticase soy agar (TSA) and inhibitory mold agar (IMA). Plates were incubated at 30 • C for 48 h for TSA and 72-120 h for IMA before enumeration of colonies. Individual colony phenotypes were selected for each sample and streaked for isolation. Isolated bacterial colonies were identified using the Micro Id System (Biolog, Hayward, CA, United States) or MicroSEQ 16S rDNA sequencing kit for bacteria (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Fungal colonies were identified using the MicroSEQ D2 LSU rDNA kit for fungi (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Sequencing was completed on the ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States). Bacterial and fungal DNA sequences were identified using MicroSEQ ID Software V2.0 <ref type="bibr">(Bacterial Library, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr">Fungal Library, 2011, Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Foster</ref> City, CA, United States) and/or NCBI Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).</p><p>For microbial food safety screening, sample extracts were plated onto E. coli/coliform and Staph Express Petrifilm (3M, St. Paul, MN, United States) according to manufacturer's instructions. Petrifilms were incubated at 35 • C for 24 h and colonies positive for E. coli and S. aureus were enumerated. Coliform colonies, if present, were re-isolated and further identified using Biolog GEN III plates. Screening for Salmonella was done by inoculating buffered peptone water (BPW) with 1 ml of sample extract followed by incubation at 35 • C for 24 h. For selective enrichment, 1 ml of the incubated BPW was transferred into 5 ml of Rappaport-Vassiliadis (RV) broth or Tetrathionate broth (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) and incubated for 24 h at 35 • C. Broths were then streaked onto selective media for Salmonella and incubated at 35 • C for 24-48 h. These methods were adapted from the FDA bacteriological analytical manual (FDA U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2018).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microbial DNA Isolation, 16S and ITS PCR, and Sequencing</head><p>DNA was isolated from sample material processed for microbiological analysis described above. Each sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm to pellet microbial cells, suspended in RNAlater and stored at -80 • C until processing for DNA isolation was completed. DNA was extracted from plant leaf and root material of the Veggie pillows using the Microbial Cell DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Inc, Carlsbad, CA, United States) then quantified using the Qubit 2.0 double stranded DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). The variable 4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) was selected as a phylogenetic marker to identify microorganisms taxonomically to the species level. A dual indexing system for multiplexing was adapted for these communities and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was optimized for reagent concentrations and volume. Each community was labeled with two barcoded primers for identification at completion of sequencing. Amplicons were created in triplicate using 1 ng of template DNA, and final reagent concentrations of 1X buffer, 200 µM dNTP's, 25 mM MgCl 2 , and 300 nM each barcoded 16S rRNA gene primer for bacterial identification or barcoded ITS primers for fungal identification <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bokulich and Mills, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kozich et al., 2013)</ref>. The PCR cycling conditions were 95 • C for 5 min to denature the Taq polymerase enzyme, followed by 30 cycles of 95 • C for 1 min, 58 • C for annealing and 72 • C for 2 min for extension. A final 10 min extension of 72 • C completed the PCR run on a Bio-Rad C-1000 thermocycler. After PCR all amplicons were purified using the Min-Elute System (Qiagen, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and quantified with the Qubit 2.0 high sensitivity ds DNA assay (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, United States). The purified amplicons were then pooled in an equimolar concentration to create the library following Illumina protocols. The sample library was combined with a 10% Phi-X control library to create diversity and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq using a V2 500-cycle kit (Illumina, Inc, San Diego, CA, United States).</p></div>

Parameters for the ASE 350 were: 100 • C with 5 min static time; 70% flush; 90 s purge; 1 cycle; and 1500 psi. Extracts were analyzed immediately after extraction for total anthocyanin content by reading their absorbance at 530 and 650 nm (Beckman DU 700).

Twenty five milligrams (25 mg) of the freeze dried sample was placed in an ASE 350 cell and extracted with acetone:water:acetic acid (AWA) at the ratio of 70%:29.5%:0.5%. Parameters for the ASE 350 were: 80 • C with 5 min static time; 60% flush; 60 s purge; 1 cycle; and 1500 psi.

A series of known concentrations of gallic acid (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) was prepared and reacted with the same reagent to create a calibration curve that was in turn used to determine the concentration in the sample extracts. Consequently, the total phenolics were expressed as gallic acid (GA) equivalents.

A "forward-then-reverse" pattern was used to place samples in the microplates, and edge wells were not used for standards or samples due to possible plate effects. Samples were analyzed on a BioTek Synergy Hybrid plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT, United States) which automatically added 200 µL of diluted fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) into each well, followed by 20 µL of the peroxyl radical generator (AAPH [2 2 azobis (2-amidinopropane)] Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States). The assay was monitored every few minutes for 2 h, at 37 • C.

It is important to note that culture based isolation utilized in this study is limited to the selection of the mostly dominant colony phenotypes that grew under aerobic conditions on one type of general growth media. A majority of the bacterial taxa isolated from the Veggie grown leaves are known endophytic and/or epiphytic phyllosphere commensals or symbionts including Arthrobacter <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Scheublin and Leveau, 2013)</ref>, Methylobacterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Peredo and Simmons, 2018)</ref>, Sphingomonas <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kim et al., 1998)</ref>, Pantoea <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Whipps et al., 2008)</ref>, Burkholderia <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Eberl and Vandamme, 2016)</ref>, and Curtobacterium <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chase et al., 2016)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Community Sequencing</head><p>Sampling and sequencing of the flight and ground Veggie grown plants were completed on a minimum of two root pillows and up to five leaf samples per grow out. Sequencing profiles for each of the Veggie plantings were used to calculate and investigate the Shannon Species Diversity Index (Alpha Diversity) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>) and establish relative diversity within the bacterial communities in leaf and root and ground and flight samples. Leaf diversity was lower than root in each of the three lettuce crops and there was no significant difference between flight and ground samples (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ref>). Although diversity was similar in all roots or leaves, there appeared to be variation in the dominant genera.</p><p>Alpha diversity in leaf tissue of the three Veggie experiments showed a significant difference between ground and flight leaf samples of VEG-03A only (P = 0.01). VEG-01A and B flight samples were not significantly different from the respective ground samples. There was also no significant difference in Beta diversity between VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A experiments. Bray Curtis dissimilarity calculations comparing all three experiments were not significantly different between any leaf or root samples of the three tests (P &gt; 0.05).</p><p>A majority of the bacterial community sequencing at the phyla level were assigned to phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi. Comparison at the phyla taxonomic level indicated no significant difference between ground and flight root communities nor in the leaf communities. The dominant phyla for all plants, both ground and flight, was Proteobacteria. VEG-03A flight roots had the lowest percent of the Proteobacteria reads at 59% while the corresponding flight leaf sample was 76% of the total bacterial communities. All other plants from VEG-01A and B ranged from 80 to 96% Proteobacterial reads. However, this disparity was not significantly different. A closer look at the genera contained in the Veggie leaf and root samples showed that Burkholderia, Ralstonia, and Janthinobacterium dominated the  Proteobacteria phyla (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). Other Proteobacteria present in the samples were Azospirillum, and Herbaspirillum, which were detected in higher abundance in VEG-03A as well as Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium, all of which may play a role in nitrogen fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Okubo et al., 2012)</ref>. The dominant genera representing the Chloroflexi was the gram positive, thermophilic, Thermogemmatispora, a soil microbe <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Komaki et al., 2016)</ref>. These microbes were also transported to the leaf but were detected in much lower abundances (percentage), particularly in the flight and ground samples in VEG-03A. Thermogemmatispora was also detected in higher percentages than other microbes but was less than in VEG-03A. The dominant microbe representing the Bacteroidetes, which took second to the Proteobacteria in numerous samples was Chitinophaga. Chitinophaga was higher in abundance of reads in flight sample roots with only VEG-01B showing an elevated abundance in the ground samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>). Fungal communities from VEG-01A and VEG-01B were surveyed and it was determined that the Ascomycota phyla dominated both flight and ground communities as well as leaf and root communities (92-99%). Few Basidiomycota were detectable. VEG-01A flight roots presented the highest representation at 7% with VEG-01B flight root community containing 6%. All other communities contained 2% or less of total fungi detected (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).</p><p>Fungal diversity in the root samples for both flight and ground was significantly higher than leaf -an expected outcome (P &lt; 0.05).

Leaf samples also housed Alternaria, Fusarium (VEG-01B only), and Malassezia, a yeast like fungi. Root samples from all three growth tests had increased levels of Alternaria, Phaeoacremonium, and Rhodosporidiobolus (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Differences in culturable bacterial and fungal density on the leaves in each of the Veggie plantings can not necessarily be traced to a particular source or environmental condition.  However, it is reasonable to conclude that environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, water levels provided, the microbiota in the air on ISS, and possible human interaction at the time of growth and harvest may contribute to the microbial community and density on the surface of the leaves. Terrestrially, airborne bacteria and fungal spores can land on the surface of leaves and become a part of the epiphytic microbial community albeit transient and dynamic depending on selective pressures <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lindow and Brandl, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Vokou et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Maignien et al., 2014)</ref>. Varying conditions such as humidity, leaf surface moisture and temperature can also effect the colonization and growth of bacteria and fungi on leaf surfaces. There is a positive correlation between fungal sporulation and the duration of leaf surface moisture <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Talley et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Li et al., 2014)</ref>.</p><p>Poor air circulation can cause persistent droplets of moisture on the surface of a leaf due to transpiration producing a micro environment favorable for microbial proliferation. In the case of the three Veggie plantings on the ISS, environmental data collected by HOBO data recorders (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>) showed that temperature and humidity were slightly higher inside the Veggie chamber during the first 22 days of VEG-03A growth than the other two Veggie tests. Additionally, germinating seedlings in the VEG-03A test had excess moisture in the early period of growth, likely due to a fan malfunction, when compared to the VEG-01A and VEG-01B plants. It was during this experiment that our team identified a consistent anomaly with the Veggie hardware -specifically that when power is cycled to the hardware, upon restarting the fan will read "low" but it will actually be off. This problem also led to issues of excess moisture in an earlier Zinnia test but a repetition of this with lettuce confirmed the anomaly. In contrast, VEG-01A and VEG-01B tests had no fan issues, but instead the plants had some periods of low water early on (see <ref type="bibr">Massa et al., 2017a)</ref>. Given that Veggie is a manually watered system and that fluid behavior in microgravity differs considerably from that on Earth, these early Veggie experiments involved considerable variation in fluid addition as both the ground teams and the astronauts struggled to effectively water the crops. Logged data from VEG-03A were not collected for the duration of the 64 days experiment so it is speculative to conclude any correlation between microbial counts and Veggie chamber conditions. Key to this work is determining the microbiological food safety of Veggie grown crops. Bacterial and fungal counts on fresh plant material are not necessarily an indication of the food quality and microbiological safety of the item and vary depending on the type of plant <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Leff and Fierer, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Qadri et al., 2015)</ref>.

While our culture based isolation of bacteria recovered a few species unique to leaves many of the isolates present on the phyllosphere were also present in the roots. Previous work on the relationship of the phyllosphere bacterial community and airborne bacteria by <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Vokou et al.

Research on core rhizosphere and phyllosphere associated bacterial microbiota (symbiotic and pathogenic) have been described using culture-independent sequencing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019)</ref>. Next generation sequencing provides an alternative method to identify non-culturable microorganisms. It is important to identify these organisms as it may provide insight into the safety and health quality of the plants/crops being harvested and consumed. Each of the bacterial and fungal isolates identified in this study were confirmed with sequencing results, however, many additional genera were identified. Research studies indicate Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria phyla dominate communities, though differences may occur between host plant species at lower taxonomic levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Panstruga and Kuhn, 2019)</ref>. Sequencing data from the three Veggie experiments followed these trends.</p><p>Lettuce leaf tissue in all three Veggie experiments was dominated with Thermogemmatispora, a gram positive, sporulating, soil organism that has been known to produce secondary metabolites provided to plants as a secondary resource <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Komaki et al., 2016)</ref>. Thermogemmatispora has been found in lettuce seeds in high abundance but was reduced in root and leaf tissues (unpublished data, Khodadad et al). Bradyrhizobium and Mesorhizobium are also commonly found in soils as they may participate in nitrogen fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Okubo et al., 2012)</ref>. Bradyrhizobium has also been noted in higher abundance in low nutrient soils <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Okubo et al., 2012)</ref>. Both microbes were present in higher abundance in flight root samples and were low or undetectable in leaf tissue with the highest abundance in VEG-03A roots. VEG-03A was grown for longer periods of time and may have depleted the nutrient levels in the substrate. In addition, microbes commonly associated with water were also detected in both leaf and root tissue. These microbes mentioned previously include Ralstonia, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, Cupriavidus, and Pseudomonas were identified in all leaf and root samples of all three Veggie experiments. These have been identified as present on ISS as well as in the ISS water system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Castro et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Checinska et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Venkateswaran et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>It is important to note that several of the microbes identified may be potential endosymbionts with plants or fungi and be present as epiphytic or endophytic organisms. One example is Chitinophaga, found in all flight and ground root samples. Though it is unknown what the function of this bacteria may have been within these Veggie communities, it has been found to interact with fungal species present in plants by enhancing nutrient uptake and growth, altering plant water interactions or deterring potential pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Shaffer et al., 2017)</ref>. These interactions have the capability of shaping plant health and productivity by accessing and making additional carbon sources available <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kivlin et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Shaffer et al., 2017)</ref>. To determine their role and benefit to plants or fungi would require additional flight and ground studies. As fungi were present in each flight and ground sample community, it is important to note those in abundance and their persistence over time. Fungi have been detected on the ISS in various locations <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Venkateswaran et al., 2014</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Venkateswaran et al., , 2017))</ref>. Leaf and root systems of VEG-01A and B were surveyed for the presence of fungi and compared. Alternaria, Microidium, and Phaeoacremonium were the top three fungal genera identified with sequencing. Alternaria, an Ascomycota, has been described as a saprophyte that may decompose organic matter, and increase in communities with high humidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Patriarca, 2016)</ref>. They may also associate with other fungal genera such as Fusarium or Stachybotrys. Though neither of these fungal genera were identified in VEG-01A, both were first detected in VEG-01B samples with higher incidence in ground samples therefore, they may have been introduced as a contaminant. Phaeoacremonium is a plant associated endophyte previously associated with lettuce and woody plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Mostert et al., 2005)</ref> while Microidium may be an opportunistic plant pathogen especially in high humidity environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Braun and Cook, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Meeboon and Takamatsu, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Plants require macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (Fe, B, Mn, Cu, Zn, Mo) for their growth and development <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Epstein, 1972)</ref>. These elements are essential and play critical roles in multiple plant processes. Comparing all three experiments, VEG-01B had higher elemental contents for Na, P, S, and Zn, whereas VEG-03A had the lowest amounts for Fe and K. Considering the chronological order of the experiments onboard the ISS, VEG-01B was grown a year later than VEG-01A, which raises the possibility of a change in the ISS water, but that may not be the only variable as plants grown in microgravity experience stresses from environmental conditions, so it would be impractical to draw any conclusions from these differences. VEG-03A, which was grown 1.5 years after the VEG-01B, was the sequential harvest experiment. As described in section "Materials and Methods, " there were four repeated harvests <ref type="bibr">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">59</ref>, and 64 days after initiation) of this experiment and only two (day 45 and day 64) were returned to earth. Romaine lettuce in field settings can take 75 days to fully mature, however, controlled environment growth is generally faster. By the final harvest photos indicated that some of the plants seemed to be transitioning to a reproductive growth phase, so it is possible that stresses from space flight may have pushed the plants to initiate senescence and that could provide a possible explanation for slightly lower elemental levels of some elements in VEG-03A samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Maillard et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Similarly, differences in the levels of total phenolics among VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A samples could be attributed to the environmental conditions. There have been known challenges associated with irrigation of plants in the Veggie hardware and VEG-01 showed evidence of insufficient and excess (in case of zinnia, VEG-01C) water in the root zone <ref type="bibr">(Massa et al., 2017a)</ref>. Studies have shown that either insufficient watering (drought-like, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sarker and Oba, 2018)</ref> or over-watering leading to hypoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Rajapakse et al., 2009)</ref> can induce production of phenolic compounds and free-radical scavenging activities. Again, there are not enough data to make any conclusions about the effects of the sequential harvesting method on plant ionome or phenolic content and more robust experiments are needed.</p><p>Numerous Veggie tests have been conducted on the ISS, the plant growth evaluated, and in some cases the leaves consumed. Three plantings of red romaine lettuce were considered here (VEG-01A, VEG-01B, and VEG-03A). Through culturable and non-culturable methods of microbial analysis, the Veggie tests demonstrated diverse microbial communities with no potential human pathogens detected and therefore could provide a safe supplement to the astronauts' diet. Chemical analysis provided evidence of significant changes in elemental and antioxidant content which may be an important factor to consider for nutritional value in future, long duration, exploration missions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | Veggie payload containing a crop of mature red romaine lettuce in Veggie pillows aboard the ISS with the light panel off (left) and red light panel on (right).
