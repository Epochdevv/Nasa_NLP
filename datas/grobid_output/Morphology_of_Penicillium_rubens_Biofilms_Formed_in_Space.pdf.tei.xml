<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fungi biofilms have been found growing on spacecraft surfaces such as windows, piping, cables, etc. The contamination of these surfaces with fungi, although undesirable, is highly difficult to avoid. While several biofilm forming species, including Penicillium rubens, have been identified in spacecraft, the effect of microgravity on fungal biofilm formation is unknown. This study sent seven material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) inoculated with spores of P. rubens to the International Space Station and allowed biofilms to form for 10, 15, and 20 days to understand the effects of microgravity on biofilm morphology and growth. In general, microgravity did not induce changes in the shape of biofilms, nor did it affect growth in terms of biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage. However, microgravity increased or decreased biofilm formation in some cases, and this was incubation-time-and materialdependent. Nanograss was the material with significantly less biofilm formation, both in microgravity and on Earth, and it could potentially be interfering with hyphal adhesion and/or spore germination. Additionally, a decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days, potentially due to nutrient depletion, was seen in some space and Earth samples and was material-dependent.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Biofilms are cell populations that grow embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM), which has effects on its ability to adhere to itself and to surfaces, and which changes the interaction between cells and nutrients, quorum-sensing molecules, and its environment in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. For example, it is estimated that up to 80% of bacterial and archaeal cells in nature grow as biofilm populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The ability of fungi, eukaryotic organisms, to form biofilms depends, in part, on the substratum upon which they form <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and occurs in a six-phase fashion: arrival at substratum, adhesion, colonization, ECM production, biofilm maturation, and dispersal <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>One of the most important phases in biofilm formation is adhesion and depends largely on cell-surface and cell-cell adhesion. Following adhesion, microbes proliferate and form the ECM. The ECM has antimicrobial-resistant properties complicating the removal of fungal cells from surfaces. If the process of adhesion is blocked, proliferation and formation of the extracellular matrix will be prevented, providing an ideal way to stop biofilm development <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The factors contributing to the fungal biofilm adherence are dependent on the species and strain. Past studies have identified hydrophobicity as a determinant for fungal biofilm adhesion, while other studies concluded that hydrophobicity of the material alone is not enough to determine adhesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. The lack of a consensus on the role of material hydrophobicity in biofilm adherence complicates the development of a biofilm-resistant material.</p><p>Because fungal biofilms are challenging to remove from surfaces due to the ECM, fungal biofilms, or molds, which in the context of this investigation are considered equivalent to fungal biofilms, are a concern for human spaceflight for at least two reasons. The first comes from the potential damage to the surfaces (namely equipment) upon which they grow. Fungal biofilms can directly damage surfaces by using the material as a source of energy, or indirectly by degrading it with enzymes and other metabolic byproducts <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. This is not an unfounded concern, as there have been issues derived from fungal biofilm formation in previous space stations. On the Soviet Salyut 6 space station, fungal biofilms were observed on "piping and equipment behind the panels" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. On Salyut 7, fungal growth was found on the water condensation system used for water recycling, the radiator of the thermal system, and on electric connectors and cables, in some of which "holes" on the insulation tape were observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. On the Mir space station, fungal biofilms (Penicillium chrysogenum now called Penicillium rubens <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) started growing on windows' rubber seals and expanded onto (and damaged) the quartz and titanium frame. Fungal biofilms were also reported on components of the air conditioning system and on cables using the electric insulation as a source of food. Furthermore, there were "zones completely covered with growth of mold fungi destruction of the plates" on the oxygen electrolysis block, and fungal biofilms were observed on the head phone of the EVA suit, lavatory pan, piping of the thermal control system, urine processing assembly, etc. Cosmonauts reported fungal growths, usually observed on moist areas where water condensed over "cold" material surfaces, as yellow or orange, or as "white powder", sometimes "the size of a football" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Both in the Mir space station as well as in the International Space Station (ISS), Penicillium has been the most isolated genus of fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Many of the fungi isolated from Mir were known biodegraders of polymers and showed more aggressive post-flight colony formation and biodegradation activity than reference strains, which the authors suggested could have been caused by the exposure to changes in radiation level, magnetic fields, or solar activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>The second reason why fungal biofilms are a concern to human spaceflight is medical in nature. The ECM and altered cell-cell communication via quorum-sensing molecules can increase antifungal resistance and pathogenicity compared to planktonic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, and the biofilms can serve as reservoirs of persistent sources of infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Fungi can cause infections in humans that are harder to diagnose and treat than those of bacterial origin <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, resulting in failure of antifungal therapy, which may require surgical intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and translate into high mortality rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Catheters can be colonized by fungal biofilms, from which cells can detach and cause acute fungemia and disseminated infection that may require long-term antifungal treatments. Similarly, fungi can infect the respiratory tract, causing bronchitis and other types of infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Fungi can cause superficial and invasive infections, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, particularly among the immunocompromised <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, posing a threat to astronaut health as spaceflight has been shown to compromise immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and confined environments, such as spacecraft, can increase exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>. Particularly, Penicillium rubens has been reported to cause rare but severe cases of esophagitis, endophthalmitis, and invasive pulmonary mycosis among immunocompromised individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>While these challenges are significant for space stations orbiting Earth, even greater complications can arise in long-term missions. For example, in case of an emergency, such as critical equipment failure or urgent medical needs, the crew can potentially be back on the ground in a matter of hours. However, this will not be true for missions beyond the lower Earth orbit (LEO), including trips around the Moon, Earth-Mars transit, or on space habitats on the Moon and Mars <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Although microbial planktonic growth has been studied in relative detail in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, little is known about fungal behavior in space when grown as biofilms. In fact, to the best of our knowledge, fungal biofilm growth in space has not been assessed and compared to ground controls, particularly how surface area coverage, biomass, and biofilm thickness change as a function of gravity, time, and material upon which they grow. Conversely, focus has been given to bacterial studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. This was one of the objectives of our Space Biofilms project performed on the ISS. Here, we report on morphological characteristics of P. rubens biofilms grown for 10, 15, or 20 days on seven different spacecraftand nosocomial-relevant materials on board the ISS, and how they compare against their matched ground controls. Separately, we have reported on the original design of this experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and on the changes in bacterial biofilm formation in microgravity, also as part of our Space Biofilm project <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Due to the frequency of fungal contamination on spaceflight hardware and habitats and the risks fungal colonization poses to astronaut health and mission success, it is critical to better understand the effect of spaceflight on fungal biofilm development.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Test Matrix: Fungal Strain, Materials, and Experimental Organization</head><p>Penicillium rubens ATCC ¬Æ 28089‚Ñ¢ was chosen given the genus ubiquity in space stations and this specific strain's presence (and damage caused) in the Mir space station <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>. The experiment examined the effect of (i) gravity (microgravity on board ISS vs. 1 g control in our lab on Earth), (ii) incubation duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref>, and 20 days), and (iii) material substratum (seven materials tested) on fungal biofilm morphology. As described in further detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the materials chosen (and why there were chosen) for this experiment were:</p><p>1.</p><p>Aluminum Alloy (Al6061), as it is used in spacecraft structures, thermal control, structures for electronic devices and panels, etc.; 2.</p><p>Stainless Steel 316 (SS316), as it is used in spacecraft environmental control and life support system (ECLSS) tanks and tubing (including for potable water), and Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) elements, and on Earth in surgical equipment and implants; 3.</p><p>Quartz, as it is used in spacecraft windows (at least one of them in the Mir space station damaged by P. rubens); 4.</p><p>Silicone, as it used in space in O-rings and on Earth in urological catheters, surgical incision drains, and respiratory devices; 5.</p><p>Titanium alloy (Ti-6Al-4V), as it is used in spacecraft structures, antennae, pressure vessels, brackets, fittings, etc., and on Earth in implants; 6.</p><p>Carbon fiber, as it is used in spacecraft aeroshells and other applications; 7.</p><p>MIT Nanograss, chosen to be interrogated as a potential solution to fungal biofilm formation in space. This was developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and is the substrate (nanoetched silicon wafer) described in the making of a lubricant-impregnated surface (LIS) without the lubricant oil and treated to increase hydrophobicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</p><p>For each of these materials except SS316, six replicates of each incubation time were launched to ISS to be fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at the end of the incubation period (for the post-flight morphology studies presented in this manuscript). SS316 was set up similarly but had 12 replicates per incubation time to enable more in-depth morphology analyses. Additionally, all materials had seven replicates of per incubation time launched to the ISS to be preserved in RNAlater (except MIT's Nanograss, which only had 6 replicates) for post-flight differential gene expression analyses (samples available through NASA's space Biology Biospecimen Sharing Program). This yielded a total of 288 space samples. An equivalent set (288 samples) was prepared at the same time as the Earth control. Additionally, a time zero (t 0 ) set of samples that included seven replicates per material was also prepared.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Pre-Launch Preparation</head><p>The following describes the preparation of the Space Biofilms fungal samples prior to launch. Preparation of space and Earth control samples took place simultaneously at the Eastern Virginia Medical School (EVMS), unless otherwise specified.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.1.">Fungal Strain</head><p>One lyophilized vial of P. rubens was rehydrated with sterile water for 30 h, and then used to inoculate potato glucose agar (PGA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA, Cat. 70139) plates. After incubation for eight days at 25 ‚Ä¢ C, the plates were flooded with 6 mL of 1X PBS (Sigma Cat. P4417) and colonies were gently rubbed with an inoculation loop to dislodge spores. The spore solution was then used to inoculate new PGA plates (working plates) in a 6 √ó 6 grid fashion. The working plates were six days old when used to inoculate the material coupons with spores (Section 2.2.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.2.">Preparation of Syringes</head><p>To provide a humid environment ideal for fungal growth, a couple of absorbent mats inside the flight hardware needed to be wet at the experiment's start (once in microgravity) (described in more detail in Section 2.2.5). Additionally, the experiment's termination for morphology samples consisted of fixation with 4% PFA, while for transcriptomic samples, of preservation in RNAlater. In preparation for these tasks, 3 mL syringes filled with 3 mL of sterile distilled water, and 5 mL syringes filled with 4 mL of 4% PFA (diluted with 1X PBS from 16% PFA, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, MA, USA, Cat. 43368) or RNAlater (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat. R0901) were prepared ahead of time.</p></div>

Silicone coupons were cleaned by bag wash, rinsed, dried, and subsequently labeled. MIT Nanograss coupons were not cleaned, as they were prepared in sterile conditions. All coupons were submerged in 70% ethanol for 15 min on each side and left to air dry inside the biosafety cabinet to disinfect the material surfaces. Once completely dried, the coupons were submerged in sterile Potato Dextrose Broth (Sigma-Aldrich, P6685) for 30 min and allowed to air dry overnight at room temperature; this supplemented the surface with nutrients to promote fungal growth over the coupons. The next day, coupons were carefully handled (never touching the surface, only the edges) to stick the cardboard side of 1 cm 2 pieces of double-sided tape (3M, Saint Paul, MN, USA, Cat.

One sterile riser was inserted in each well of a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) 24well plate (CellTreat, Pepperell, MA, USA, Cat. 229524) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2a</ref>). An inoculated coupon was then placed on top and adhered to the riser (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2b</ref>) and secured in place by pressing gently on the corners. The plates contained 24 coupons placed in a random fashion (ISS and Earth equivalent plates matching) to reduce the effect of a possible humidity or oxygen gradient in the Plate Habitat (PHAB). To ensure the safety of the crew and the space station, a sterile and gas-permeable Breathe-Easy membrane (Sigma, Cat. Z380059) was placed over each plate (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">2c</ref>) to seal and contain the fungi and spores. The use of the silicone risers reduced the working volume in the well to 0.7 mL, rising the material coupon closer to the membrane, and minimizing the volume of fixative/preservative needed to terminate the experiment. This resulted in reduced crew time, launch mass, and volume.

The temperature and relative humidity (RH) recorder was used to determine whether the environment was similar between PHABs. The PHAB was used as the secondary containment for the samples as well as a tool to maintain humidity and promote fungal growth. Each PHAB was designated to a particular incubation time and gravitational condition; three were sent to the ISS (one corresponding to 10, 15, and 20 days of incubation), while three equivalent PHABs were kept on Earth as controls.

Thus, all the images were converted to .tiff files using ImageJ v1.48 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. To this end, the nd2 file was opened in the ImageJ software and the two channels were merged, and then the composite was subsequently converted to RGB color, 8-bit, and finally .tiff file. The ImageJ plugin Slice Remover <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> was used to remove the slices of the image stacks that did not have any relevant biofilm information (i.e., underneath the bottom layer and over the topmost layer where no biofilm signal was recorded).

The images were converted into OME-Tiff files using the ImageJ macro "Convert to OME-Tiff" to ensure compatibility with COMSTAT 2. Each OME-Tiff file was analyzed using the following parameters: (i) automatic thresholding with Otsu's Method, and (ii) no connected volume filtering. The measurements produced by the software were (a) biomass and (b) thickness distribution. A proxy for biomass, which will be referred to as biomass for the purpose of this investigation, is calculated in COMSTAT2 as the ratio of volume per unit area. Using the data for 0 ¬µm thickness, we calculated the (c) surface area coverage of the biofilm. As a quality control step, each mask created by COMSTAT2 was compared with the original .nd2 files to check for resemblance between the two files. The images which were far off from the original image were re-analyzed with a manual threshold instead of automatic threshold.</p><p>The biomass of each of the t 0 samples was produced by COMSTAT2 using the same methodology. Thickness and surface area were not calculated as these samples only contained spores which could be stacked or clumped together, potentially leading to a false statistical significance when comparing amount of spores. Biomass was hence deemed the best parameter to examine for this set of samples as it takes into account the overall volume occupied by the spores.</p></div>

These two cases, where fungal biofilms on Earth grew better than in space, are of particular interest because those samples correspond to the conditions (Earth at 10 days and 20 days) that experienced fluctuations of humidity (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5</ref>). The ideal RH for P. chrysogenum is 90%, and decreases in fungal growth below this RH have been observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>. Previous studies have shown that drops in humidity can immediately stop growth and cause the dehydration of P. rubens <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. On occasion, the fungus is able to start growing again when the humidity increases, but other times, RH fluctuations (of as little as 3 h) can suppress growth permanently, so only new germination can occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Additionally, there is evidence that after being exposed to high humidity, P. rubens cannot restart growth following a desiccation event of RH below 75% <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. Since the humidity fluctuations in Earth PHABs of 10 and 20 days lasted for days and the PHABs reached RH of 50% and below, we expected the fungal growth to be impaired for those samples. Hence, it is possible that if RH values would have been equivalent between flight and ground in the day 10 and 20 PHABs, even more biofilm growth could have been observed on Earth. Nevertheless, this would not change our relative observation presented here-likely except for Titanium Alloy at 20 days, results that may be an artifact of the RH challenges. Quartz at 20 days was an exception to this trend as an increase in biofilm formation was seen despite lower RH values. While we have no clear explanation as to why this occurred, a previous study classified P. chrysogenum (the previous species name for P. rubens) as xerotolerant, meaning it can undergo a complete life cycle at low RH values and is considered resistant to dry environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. While this was not studied specifically in this investigation, how P. rubens survives in dry environments should be further examined.</p><p>With that in mind, our results suggest mixed effects of microgravity on biofilm growth dependent on the material surface and without a clear trend in time. It is important to note the significant outlier in the Carbon Fiber 10-day sample grown on Earth and the effect of removing this outlier from the statistical test. When removed, the comparison between Earth and space sample groups is no longer significant; however, all of the other observed differences remain the same, which implies mixed effects of microgravity on biofilm growth. Despite the changes in biofilm growth in microgravity, no consistent visual trends in morphological shape (overall 3D structure) across gravity conditions were observed. Therefore, in our experiment, microgravity did not impact the fungal shape of the biofilm. The mechanisms behind the changes in fungal biofilm formation in microgravity are still unclear and need further investigation. One potential mechanism behind the changes observed in this investigation could lie in how different fungi sense gravity. The octahedral crystal matrix protein (OCTIN) is the structural protein comprising the vacuolar protein crystals that the fungal family Mucorales uses to sense gravity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. While this protein does not exist in Penicillium species, other unknown gravity sensing proteins could be present. Research into how other fungal families, such as Penicillium, might be capable of sensing gravity is a crucial next step to understanding fungal biofilm growth in microgravity and the changes in biofilm formation observed in this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">The Effect of Material Surface on Biofilm Growth</head><p>After qualitative analysis of the fungal biofilms, no difference in biofilm shape was observed across materials (Appendix B). However, significant differences in mass, thickness, and surface area coverage of the biofilms between materials were identified.</p><p>The Nanograss material was of particular interest in this investigation as a potential biofilm-resistant material. Nanograss was the most efficient material at reducing fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth. One potential explanation for the reduced biofilm formation is a reduced strength of adhesion. Spore adhesion was the same across all materials by 6 h time (Appendix A), meaning all spores were at minimum equivalently loosely adhered to the material surface. Adhesion strength, how strongly the fungi adheres to the material, and how much force the spores or biofilm can withstand before being removed are dependent on various material characteristics such as hydrophobicity, roughness, and charge <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. Hydrophobicity is unlikely to be a factor contributing to the reduced biofilm growth. This is due to hydrophobins, which are proteins that help to determine a fungal spores' hydrophobicity. One hydrophobin, RodA, has been shown to coat the outside of spores, forming a hydrophobic rodlet layer in Aspergillus fumigatus, and other hydrophobins have been identified in hyphae <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. An ortholog RodA gene with 100% query cover (E value 0.0, and 90.40% identity) was found in P. rubens (Accession No. AM920436.1) using NCBI's BLAST Tool, meaning that P. rubens could also have hydrophobic spores if this gene is being expressed. Nanograss is a highly hydrophobic material and therefore should allow the P. ruben spores to strongly adhere. Therefore, hydrophobicity is not the factor interfering with spore and hyphal adhesion preventing biofilm formation on Nanograss.</p><p>Other factors such as surface roughness and charge are likely at play in preventing biofilm growth on Nanograss <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. In the majority of previous research, P. rubens biofilms have been grown on gypsum, and data on the effect of roughness and surface charge on P. rubens biofilm formation are not available. Additionally, data on the roughness and charge of the materials used in this investigation are not available as these properties are manufacturer-and sometimes batch-dependent. Future experiments should measure this material's properties to examine the effect of different material charges and roughness on biofilm growth on hydrophobic materials. Due to the decreased biofilm formation on Nanograss, this material warrants further studies with varying conditions and strains to determine its full potential as an anti-microbial material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The Effect of Incubation Time on Biofilm Growth</head><p>A decrease in biofilm growth was observed as incubation time increased in three cases: Titanium Alloy Earth samples (mass and thickness decreased between day 15 and day 20 and surface area decreased between day 10 and day 20), Quartz space samples (thickness decrease between day 15 and day 20), and Stainless Steel Earth samples (surface area decrease between day 10 and day 20). Since there was only a thin coat of PDB on the surface of the coupons, it is possible the nutrients were depleted as incubation time increased, causing the fungal biofilms to be in a starvation state. When in unfavorable conditions, small groups of fungal persister cells will form and remain even as other fungal cells die <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. These cell populations have decreased metabolism and growth, allowing the biofilm to remain at a stable population level until conditions improve and growth can resume <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Furthermore, Candida albicans, another fungal species known for biofilm formation, can maintain a consistent population in starvation after an initial drop in cell population <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>. If the biofilms have depleted resources by day 15, a decrease in overall biofilm mass, thickness, and surface area can be expected as the cell population will start to die but maintains a minimum population with the assistance of persister cells. The reduced biofilms observed at day 20 could contain these persister cells, which would allow the biofilm to continue growth during a longer incubation time if the environment becomes favorable again, which could present a possible risk for future long-term missions. Further studies should be conducted to observe the effect of adding more nutrients to the fungal population after 20 days in microgravity. In the future, analyses of persister cells within the biofilm and their gene expression should be conducted, comparing the number of persister cells formed both in space and on Earth. This is especially relevant because the persister cells are more resistant to antimicrobials, and in confined spaces such as spacecraft, they could pose an increased health risk for astronauts.</p><p>Another possibility for the decrease in biofilm formation on day 20 due to depleted nutrients is the weakening of cell-cell and cell-surface adhesions. Fungi have two types of adhesion proteins which are vital for cell-cell adhesion and cell-surface adhesion, lectin-like adhesions and sugar-independent adhesins <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Depleted nutrients decrease the amount of available sugars for the adhesins to bind to, potentially decreasing the strength of cellsurface adhesion. Whether the sugar-independent adhesions are sufficient to maintain a strong attachment is unknown and was not studied in this investigation. However, if the sugar-independent adhesions are insufficient, then fungi with a loose attachment were potentially washed away in the gentle washing steps during staining. Further studies should be conducted to determine if the depleted resources decreased the strength of biofilm adherence.</p><p>Altogether, the results show that microgravity does not have a strong effect on biofilm shape and morphology of P. rubens up to 20 days of incubation. Even in the few cases where there was increased biofilm formation in microgravity, this effect was not maintained in time. Additionally, due to the reduced fungal biofilm formation, both in space and on Earth, Nanograss could be considered as a potential anti-microbial material for certain spacecraft equipment. The results presented in this manuscript can contribute to the efforts of fungal biofilm control in space, but long-term tests (&gt;20 days) as well as complementary              </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
