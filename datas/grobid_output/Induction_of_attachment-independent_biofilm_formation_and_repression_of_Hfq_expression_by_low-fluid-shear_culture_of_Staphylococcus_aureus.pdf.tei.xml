<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus encounters a wide variety of fluid shear levels within the human host, and they may play a key role in dictating whether this organism adopts a commensal interaction with the host or transitions to cause disease. By using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors to create a physiologically relevant, low-fluid-shear environment, S. aureus was evaluated for cellular responses that could impact its colonization and virulence. S. aureus cells grown in a low-fluid-shear environment initiated a novel attachment-independent biofilm phenotype and were completely encased in extracellular polymeric substances. Compared to controls, low-shear-cultured cells displayed slower growth and repressed virulence characteristics, including decreased carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and reduced survival in whole blood. Transcriptional whole-genome microarray profiling suggested alterations in metabolic pathways. Further genetic expression analysis revealed downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq, which parallels low-fluid-shear responses of certain Gram-negative organisms. This is the first study to report an Hfq association with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response to fluid shear among structurally diverse prokaryotes. Collectively, our results suggest S. aureus responds to a low-fluid-shear environment by initiating a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence characteristics, which could lead to insight into key factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Fluctuations in fluid shear are encountered by pathogenic microorganisms as they occupy various host sites throughout the course of infection and/or during colonization <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(46)</ref>. This is especially true for the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, which is able to adapt to and proliferate under a variety of environmental conditions, thus enabling high morbidity and mortality rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(32)</ref>. The dissemination of S. aureus through a host exposes the organism to significant variations in fluid shear. For example, high levels of fluid shear (10 to 70 dynes/ cm 2 ) are encountered within the arterial blood vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(41)</ref>, whereas areas of low fluid shear could be experienced within the intestines (less than 5 dynes/cm 2 ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>. Studies on the impact of fluid shear on S. aureus have demonstrated that bacterial adherence is directly dependent on shear rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(44)</ref>. Furthermore, in response to varied levels of fluid flux, variations on the staphylococcal cell have been investigated using flow chambers to determine changes in the presence of microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules, MSCRAMMs, which are involved in the ability of S. aureus to colonize <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref>. These investigations demonstrated that the S. aureus MSCRAMMs function in a shear-dependent manner, whereby the binding efficiency to host factors peaks under conditions of low fluid shear <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">54)</ref>.</p><p>Previous investigations have also demonstrated the ability of S. aureus to sense and respond to fluid shear flux by altering biofilm architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63)</ref>. Specifically, studies of indwelling medical devices have indicated that S. aureus is an efficient biofilm former under various degrees of fluid shear <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">63)</ref>. The impact of fluid shear on staphylococcal biofilms has resulted in correlations between physiological levels of oscillatory shear stress and biofilm morphology and tolerance to antibiotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref>. Those investigations determined that the most turbulent flow conditions resulted in the thickest biofilm morphology and highest level of antibiotic resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(31)</ref>. Moreover, in response to fluid shear, the viscoelasticity of S. aureus biofilms permits them to remain attached yet undergo rolling migration, thereby promoting bacterial dispersal while remaining in the protected biofilm state <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(63)</ref>. However, the role of low fluid shear levels, in relation to biofilm formation and downstream staphylococcal responses, is unclear.</p><p>Approximately 60% of the human population intermittently carries S. aureus, with the highest isolation rates from the nasal pharynx <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(30)</ref>. The isolation of S. aureus in stool samples and rectal sites is not uncommon, with previous studies demonstrating the presence of the same strain repeatedly isolated from the nose and stool samples/rectal sites of the same individuals over long periods of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61)</ref>, suggesting that the organism either repeatedly passes from the nose through the digestive system or maintains a long-term presence in the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the passage through the gastrointestinal tract exposes S. aureus to various environmental conditions, including those present in the intestine. Cells within the intestine, both host epithelium and inhabiting microbes, are exposed to various levels of fluid shear <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. A bolus moving through the center of the lumen creates the highest shear level, which decreases with proximity toward the intestinal wall. The mucus layer provides a barrier that greatly reduces shear rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(55)</ref>. It has been postulated that if the intestinal epithelial cells lacked microvilli, the fluid shear stress they would experience would be in the range of 1 to 5 dynes/cm 2 ; however, the presence of microvilli further reduces the shear rates around these cells to less than 1 dyne/cm 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>. The viscoelastic properties of the mucus layer itself provide protection for objects within the mucus from high shear rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(7)</ref>. As a well-established intestinal colonizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61)</ref> that adheres to intestinal mucus <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(70)</ref>, S. aureus is exposed to the low fluid shear levels descriptive of this site.</p><p>To facilitate studies in which planktonic microorganisms can be subjected to physiologically relevant levels of fluid shear, investigations have capitalized on the low-shear environment produced in NASA-designed rotating-wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, which were originally used as spaceflight analog cell culture systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>. The RWV is a thin, cylindrical vessel (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>) that, when completely filled with culture medium and rotated on an axis parallel to the ground, results in solid body rotation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>. Microorganisms in this environment are maintained in suspension (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>) and experience a physiological low level of fluid shear over their cell surface, previously described as low-shear-modeled microgravity (LSMMG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49)</ref>. Mathematical modeling has demonstrated that the fluid shear level within the RWV is less than 1 dyne/cm 2 and that incremental increases in fluid shear levels in the RWV result in corresponding changes in the microbial response <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(46)</ref>. As this level of fluid shear reflects the fluid shear levels previously described for the brush border of the intestine, the RWV has been proposed as a model for investigating the effects of low fluid shear levels that are similar to those in the intestine <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">58)</ref>.</p><p>The effects of the low-fluid-shear culture environment of the RWV on microbial responses have been most thoroughly documented for Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Specifically, LSSMG culture enhanced the virulence of this organism in a murine model of infection, increased its stress resistance profiles, and induced global alterations in gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">74)</ref>. Moreover, it was found that the RNA chaperone protein, Hfq, was a major regulator of the LSMMG-induced molecular genetic response in S. Typhimurium <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(72)</ref>. Hfq is a conserved global regulator that facilitates the binding of small regulatory RNAs with mRNAs to exert translational regulation in response to environmental stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(72)</ref>. Subsequent studies have also identified a role for Hfq in regulating the LSMMG-induced response of Pseudomonas aeruginosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>. Hfq and Hfq homologues are highly conserved across prokaryotic and eukaryotic species and have been connected to the stress response and virulence of many pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(68)</ref>. In more recent studies, Rosado et al. investigated the culture of methicillinsusceptible S. aureus (MSSA) in the low-fluid-shear environment of the RWV <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref>. No differences in growth profiles or MICs of various antibiotics were observed between LSMMG and control cultured S. aureus <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref>. However, those authors did report decreases in carotenoid production, alterations in red blood cell lysis, and the differential expression of two genes involved in metabolism and transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref>.</p><p>A caveat for the study of pathogenic microorganisms is their ability to survive and adjust their virulence characteristics in response to rapidly changing, often extreme environmental conditions, including low fluid shear. However, there has been little investigation into the responses of S. aureus to the environmental conditions it encounters in vivo, where it rarely causes disease, for example, in the nasal pharynx, skin surface, and intestine. By investigating the mechanisms it utilizes to repress virulence at these sites, we can increase our understanding of the environmental triggers that lead to the initiation of virulence. The present studies were performed to determine the effect of low-fluid-shear culture on methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) to elucidate impacts on cellular responses, such as biofilm formation, which has been postulated for many microorganisms in the intestines, where lowshear conditions exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">40)</ref>. Furthermore, as multiple Gram-negative microorganisms have been shown to use Hfq as a common molecular response mechanism to low fluid shear <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72)</ref>, we evaluated key regulators of the Gram-positive organism S. aureus to determine the potential of a universally conserved response(s) to this environmental parameter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>Bacterial strains and growth conditions. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus N315 (kindly provided by Mark Shirtliff, University of Maryland Dental School) was used for all studies. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus 8325 (kindly provided by Naomi Balaban, Tufts University) was used in experiments as indicated. Prior to every experiment, S. aureus was taken from a frozen stock, inoculated into tryptic FIG. <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Operation of the RWV bioreactor (Synthecon, Houston, TX). (A) Image of the NASA-designed RWV apparatus used to create the LSMMG environment for bacterial culture. (B) The altered positioning of the RWV that results in the two culture orientations, depicting the axis of rotation. The LSMMG environment is achieved by rotation of the RWV on an axis parallel to the ground, whereas the axis of rotation in the control orientation is perpendicular to the ground. (C) Depiction of the orbital path of a cell when cultured in the LSMMG orientation. The continued combination of the sedimentation effect, whereby gravity and lack of motility cause a cell to settle to the bottom of the vessel, and the clockwise solid body rotation of the medium results in the continuous suspension of the cell in an orbit. soy broth (TSB), and grown statically overnight. Aliquots of the culture were diluted (1:200) in fresh TSB and loaded into 50-ml RCCS-1 RWV bioreactors (Synthecon, Houston, TX) in both the LSMMG orientation (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>) and control orientations (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Care was taken to ensure that no bubbles were present within the reactors, which could prevent disruption of the low-shear condition. The bioreactors were placed in a 37°C incubator and operated at 25 rpm for 20 h, at which point stationary phase was achieved.</p><p>Growth profiles. S. aureus cultures were initiated in the RWV as described above. Following 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h of growth, a 1.5-ml aliquot was removed, using a 3-ml luer lock syringe, from sampling ports on the face of the RWV. For all time points greater than 10 h, the entire RWV culture volume was used for enumerating samples by removing and vigorously vortexing the contents of the vessels, to ensure dispersion of any aggregates that had formed during culture. Homogeneous dispersion was confirmed using light microscopy. For all time points, samples were enumerated using serial dilution with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and plated on tryptic soy agar (TSA) followed by overnight culture at 37°C. Growth curves were determined using a minimum of three separate cultures for each time point.</p><p>ESEM imaging. Following 20 h of growth in the RWV, cultures of S. aureus N315 in the LSMMG orientation resulted in the presence of visible aggregates in the fluid phase of the vessel. The aggregates, as well as samples from the control vessel, were carefully removed from only the fluid phase of each vessel and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 1% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were washed three times with filter-sterilized, deionized water by gentle inversion and then loaded onto silicon wafer chips on T stubs. Samples were then dried in the chamber of the electron microscope and imaged using a Philips XL 30 environmental scanning electron microscope (ESEM; FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR).</p><p>Antibiotic resistance assay. Antibiotic resistance assays were performed using identical cultures of S. aureus N315 in four RWVs, two of which were operated in the LSMMG orientation and two in the control orientation (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). After 20 h of culture, one vessel from the LSMMG and one from the control orientation were used to determine the initial cell concentrations, defined as 100% survival, using direct plating as described above. The two remaining vessels were carefully removed from their rotation base units to retain the aggregate structure, and 2.5 ml of the medium was replaced with 2.5 ml of ciprofloxacin to a final concentration of 25 g/ml, corresponding to 50 times the MIC. To ensure that fluid shear force was no longer a variable, the vessels were allowed to sit statically at room temperature for 24 h, at which point the cell concentration was determined by serial dilution and plating as described above. Antibiotic resistance levels were determined using three independent biological samples.</p><p>Carotenoid extraction. Quantitative comparisons of carotenoid levels between LSMMG and control cultures of S. aureus N315 were achieved spectrophotometrically as previously described by Marshall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(42)</ref>. Briefly, based on growth curve estimates at 20 h, approximately 3.0 ϫ 10 7 cells were removed from both LSMMG and control cultures. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 ϫ g for 3 min, then washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 500 l of methanol, followed by a 5-min incubation in a 55°C water bath. The cells were then pelleted again and the supernatants recovered. Staphylococcus aureus 8325, which has a naturally occurring mutation in a positive regulator of sigma factor B, resulting in an unpigmented phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(33)</ref>, was extracted as described above and used to establish a baseline absorbance. The absorbance of the resulting supernatant, containing the extracted carotenoid pigments, was recorded at 460 nm. The carotenoid extraction protocol was followed for samples from three separate cultures.</p><p>Oxidative stress assay. The susceptibility to oxidative stress was determined for both S. aureus N315 and 8325. After 20 h of culture, the contents of the reactors were removed, placed into sterile containers, and vigorously vortexed for 30 s to disband biofilms. A concentrated stock solution of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was immediately added to approximately 30 ml of both LSMMG and control cultures, as cell numbers evaluated were equalized based on growth curves, bringing the overall H 2 O 2 concentration to 30 mM. Viable microbial concentrations were determined every 15 min using serial plate counts as described above.</p><p>To determine the duration of the LSMMG effect, the oxidative stress assay was repeated. S. aureus N315 was cultured for 20 h, at which point the RWV bioreactors were stopped and the contents removed and immediately placed into sterile containers, where they were allowed to sit statically. At various kinetic time points the oxidative stress assay was performed on these samples. All oxidative stress assays were performed in triplicate.</p><p>Whole-blood killing assay. All relevant blood assays were reviewed and approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the NASA Johnson Space Center prior to implementation. After 20 h of culture, S. aureus N315 cells from the LSMMG or control RWV were placed in sterile containers and vigorously vortexed for 30 s to disband biofilms. Cell concentrations were adjusted to approximately 1 ϫ 10 4 cells in 100 l of PBS. Blood was collected from healthy human subjects in heparinized tubes to coincide with the 20-h culture time point. A 900-l volume of blood was immediately added to the PBS bacterial solution. The infected blood was placed in a 37°C incubator with agitation for 4 h. Samples were removed at predetermined time points, and the viable microbial concentration was determined by serial dilution as described above. The whole-blood killing assay was performed with three technical replicates and repeated in duplicate with blood from two separate subjects.</p><p>RNA isolation. Samples of LSMMG and control cultured S. aureus N315 were immediately incubated with a 2:1 volume of RNAprotect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at room temperature for 10 min with occasional mixing to allow for RNA stabilization. Samples were centrifuged at 5,000 ϫ g for 5 min, resulting in pellets that were stored at Ϫ70°C until RNA isolation was performed. The pellets were resuspended in 350 l of RLT lysis buffer (Qiagen) containing 3.5 l of 2-mercaptoethanol. The suspension was added to approximately 250 l of ice-cold zirconia beads (Ambion, Austin, TX) in screw-cap tubes. Cells were lysed by bead beating at maximum speed for 5 min using the Mini-Beadbeater 8 (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). The lysed cell suspension was added to QIAshredder columns (Qiagen) and centrifuged at 10,000 ϫ g for 1 min. To the homogenized lysate, 250 l of 200 proof ethanol was added; this mixture was applied to an RNeasy minicolumn (Qiagen), and the standard protocol for the RNeasy minikit (Qiagen) was followed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed with Turbo DNA-free (Ambion). Denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis was used to assess the quality of RNA by visualization of intact 16S and 23S rRNA bands. RNA quantity was measured with a NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Purified RNA was stored at Ϫ70°C until use in downstream applications.</p><p>Microarray analysis. Gene expression profiling was achieved using the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA) GeneChip S. aureus genome array containing probe sets for over 3,300 open reading frames based on sequence information from four S. aureus strains, including N315. Total RNA was isolated as described above. The quality of the RNA was evaluated with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies Inc., Santa Clara, CA). GeneChip processing was performed as previously described by Dunman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(18)</ref>. Briefly, 25 g of total RNA was reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNA was labeled and fragmented to produce oligonucleotide probes in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix) for antisense prokaryotic arrays. The probes were then hybridized to S. aureus-specific GeneChips using the GeneChip hybridization oven 640 (Affymetrix). The chips were then washed and stained using the GeneChip fluidics station 400 (Affymetrix). The chips were scanned and data analyzed using an GeneArray scanner (Affymetrix). To accurately compare expression patterns, each GeneChip was hybridized with LSMMG and control-cultured cDNA from the same date of culture. Each experiment was performed in duplicate from independent biological samples. Analysis of the data by GCOS (Affymetrix) and analysis of variance, filtered with a 2-fold cutoff limit and P value of Ͻ0.05, was used to generate a list of genes that demonstrated differential expression profiles in response to LSMMG culture.</p><p>Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen) and cDNA as per the manufacturer's instructions. Primers to these genes (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) were designed and purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) using their OligoPerfect designer. Standard curves were generated for each primer pair using the QuantiFast SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) and 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) to verify primer efficiencies as well as the absence of dimers and nonspecific products; this PCR product was also assessed for the correct amplicon size via agarose gel electrophoresis. The QuantiFast SYBR green PCR kit (Qiagen) and 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) were again used to establish expression levels. Relative expression values were determined by using the ⌬⌬C T method via SDS 2.2.2 software by means of relative quantification using 16S rRNA as the endogenous reference gene (Applied Biosystems). All quantitative PCR evaluations were repeated in triplicate from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis. Student's t tests were used to determine significance between control and LSMMG samples. A P value of Ͻ0.05 was considered statistically significant and is denoted by asterisks in the relevant figures.</p><p>Microarray data accession number. The microarray data were submitted to the GenBank Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and can be found under accession number GSE28077.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>A low-fluid-shear culture environment promotes S. aureus attachment-independent biofilm formation. Visual examination of the LSMMG and control cultures of N315 indicated much greater levels of clumping in the LSMMG cultures. ESEM imaging revealed the presence of a distinct extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) completely encasing the bacterial cells that was less visible on samples from the control vessel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). The vast amount of EPS coating encasing the aggregates of low-fluid-shear-cultured staphylococcal cells is characteristic of an S. aureus biofilm.</p><p>Low-fluid-shear-cultured S. aureus aggregates are more resistant to antibiotic stress. To further investigate the biofilm phenotype, S. aureus aggregates that formed during low-fluidshear culture were evaluated for changes in ciprofloxacin resistance compared to control cultures. Ciprofloxacin was added directly to statically resting control and LSMMG cultures following 20 h of culture in the RWV in order to not disrupt low-fluid-shear-induced aggregates. After 24 h of exposure to ciprofloxacin, the S. aureus aggregates were 1.72-fold more resistant than bacteria cultured in the control orientation to the antibiotic (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). The increased resistance of the aggregates is in agreement with the characteristics of attached bacterial biofilms <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(65)</ref>.</p><p>Low-fluid-shear culture conditions result in decreased growth for S. aureus. Biofilm conditions impact metabolism and growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(65)</ref>, and previous studies of Gram-negative organisms indicated alterations in generation time and overall growth profiles <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>; therefore, we examined the growth profile of S. aureus N315. As previous studies had reported that S. VOL. 77, 2011 LOW-FLUID-SHEAR CULTURE OF S. AUREUS</p><p>aureus does not exhibit altered growth profiles in the RWV bioreactor <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref>, the growth profile of an additional strain, S. aureus 8325, was evaluated as a control to determine if any observed changes suggested a strain-specific effect. To ensure a homogeneous distribution during measurements of cell counts, the entire contents of the vessels were removed and vigorously vortexed for all time points greater than 10 h. For both S. aureus strains, N315 and 8325, the LSMMG cultured bacteria did not reach the same concentrations as the control cultures. After 20 h of growth, cell concentrations of control cultures of S. aureus N315 were 2.9-fold higher than cultures grown in the LSMMG orientation (1.86 ϫ 10 7 Ϯ 2.6 ϫ 10 6 CFU/ml versus 6.27 ϫ 10 6 Ϯ 1.32 ϫ 10 6 CFU/ml [means Ϯ standard deviations]) (Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). In a similar fashion, after 20 h of growth, CFU in control cultures of S. aureus 8325 were also significantly higher than in cultures grown in the LSMMG orientation, 5.6 ϫ 10 7 Ϯ 7.12 ϫ 10 6 CFU/ml versus 1.0 ϫ 10 7 Ϯ 2.00 ϫ 10 5 CFU/ml, respectively, indicating a 5.6-fold difference (data not shown).</p><p>Low-fluid-shear culture reduces carotenoid production in S. aureus N315. To investigate the characteristics of the individual S. aureus cells within these biofilms, LSMMG-cultured S. aureus cells were further characterized after biofilm dispersal. S. aureus N315 develops its characteristic golden yellow color due to the primary carotenoid pigment staphyloxanthin during the stationary phase of growth. It was visibly apparent that the LSMMG-cultured S. aureus N315 was less pigmented than respective control cultures. To quantify this effect on carotenoid production, carotenoid levels were measured after 20 h of growth in LSMMG and control orientations. Visual color differences between cultures grown in LSMMG and control orientations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5A</ref>) were confirmed by methanol extraction and measurement of absorbance at 460 nm as previously described by Marshall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(42)</ref>. Absorbance of the LSMMG-cultured S. aureus was significantly lower than that of control cultures (P Ͻ 0.0001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5B</ref>), although not as low as unpigmented S. aureus 8325, suggesting LSMMG-cultured S. aureus may produce an early intermediate of staphyloxanthin.</p><p>A low-fluid-shear environment enhances S. aureus N315 susceptibility to oxidative stress and is a transient effect. As carotenoids are known to have protective antioxidant properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref>, cultures of S. aureus N315 were evaluated for oxidative stress survival. As S. aureus 8325 does not produce carotenoids, the low-fluid-shear condition does not alter its pigmentation and was therefore also evaluated for susceptibility to oxidative stress. After the entire contents of the vessels were removed and vigorously vortexed, they were exposed to 30 mM hydrogen peroxide for 60 min. S. aureus N315 cultured in the LSMMG position demonstrated over 4-fold greater sensitivity to the peroxide than cultures in the control orientation FIG. 4. Comparative growth curves of S. aureus N315 when cultured in either the LSMMG or control orientation. Culture in the LSMMG environment resulted in a 2.9-fold decrease in cell concentrations compared to control cultures. FIG. 5. Decreased carotenoid production of S. aureus N315 in response to LSMMG culture. (A) Centrifugation of the control and LSMMG cultures resulted in a visual difference in the pigmentation of the pellets. (B)</p><p>To quantitate the differences in carotenoid production, the carotenoids were extracted and measured spectrometrically at 460 nm. There was a significant reduction in absorbance of the LSMMGcultured bacteria compared to the control ‫,ء(‬ P Ͻ 0.0001). S. aureus 8325, which does not produce carotenoids, was used as a negative control for comparison.</p><p>(Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). As expected, the unpigmented S. aureus 8325 cultures did not display any differences between LSMMG and control orientations (data not shown), suggesting that the increased susceptibility to oxidation may be associated with the decreased production of carotenoids.</p><p>To determine the duration of the LSMMG effect of increased sensitivity to oxidative stress, LSMMG and control cultures were removed from the RWVs after 20 h, vortexed, and placed into sterile containers, where they remained static. Every 30 min, samples from the S. aureus N315 cultures were subjected to the oxidative stress assay described above. When the difference in survival failed to show statistical significance, we determined that the LSMMG effect had dissipated (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Based upon our observations from this assay, the LSMMG effect on S. aureus is transient, lasting less than 1.5 h once removed from the low-fluid-shear environment.</p><p>Low-fluid-shear culture conditions enhance the susceptibility of S. aureus N315 to human whole blood. As increased oxidative stress susceptibility could indicate a decreased survival of bacteria versus innate immune cells, we investigated the survival of LSMMG-cultured S. aureus against immune components present in whole blood. To accomplish this, human subjects were scheduled for blood draws at precisely 20 h postinoculation of the RWVs with S. aureus. The whole blood was immediately returned to the lab for challenge with either the LSMMG-or control-cultured bacteria. After incubation in whole blood for 4 h, S. aureus cultured in the LSMMG orientation was significantly more susceptible to killing than controls (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). Interestingly, the difference in percent survival between control and low-shear cultures in our two samples from different subjects was approximately 30%, revealing a consistent trend in the susceptibility of low-shear-cultured S. aureus (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>).</p></div>

The majority of these genes are involved in metabolic processes, specifically, carbohydrate, pyruvate, and arginine metabolism, or responding to environmental stressors. Genes that displayed increased expression in response to the LSMMG environment were dispersed throughout the staphylococcal chromosome, with three instances where the genes belonged to the same operon. Alignment of the LSMMG-responsive genes revealed the conserved motif t/aTGTGA t/a 6 TCACAt/a (with the most common nucleotides in lowercase and portions of the sequence representing regulatory binding sites underlined) in the regulatory reof pflA and pflB, encoding formate acetyltransferase and formate acetyltransferase activating enzyme (SA0218 and SA0219); adh1, encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (SA0562); ddh, encoding D-lactate dehydrogenase (SA2312); and a hypothetical protein (SA2268).

Additionally, the sigma factor B (SigB) promoter consensus sequence, GTTTa/ta/ t 12-15 GGGa/tAa/t <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref>, was located in regulatory regions of the operon containing alkaline shock protein 23 (SA1984 to SA1986), and ORFs of an ATP-dependent protease, clpL (SA2336); myosin-cross-reactive streptococcal antigen homo-FIG. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. LSMMG-cultured S. aureus N315 is more susceptible to killing by oxidative stress.

To test the duration of the LSMMG effect, samples of both the LSMMG and control bacteria were allowed to sit statically, out of the vessels, for a period of time (1, 1.5, and 2 h) and then subjected to H 2 O 2 . At 1.5 h there failed to be a significant ‫,ء(‬ P Ͻ 0.05) difference in the survival rates of the LSMMG-and control-cultured bacteria after 60 min, and it was determined that the LSMMG effect had diminished.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Within the large intestine exists a vast range of microenvironments attributable to luminal flow rates, variations in the mucus layer, interactions with epithelial surfaces, and contin-ually changing levels of nutrients, which microorganisms must be able to withstand <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(40)</ref>. Material flowing through the intestinal lumen is the source of high levels of shear that bacterial cells must first endure prior to colonization <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(66)</ref>. Once out of the direct flow in the lumen, successful colonizers assemble near the intestinal walls, where they encounter intestinal epithelial cells and decreased levels of fluid shear <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(24)</ref>.

Additionally, previous research has demonstrated the importance of the cecal mucus layer, within the intestinal tract of the mouse, in providing a key niche facilitating intestinal colonization by S. aureus <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(23)</ref>.

S. aureus has long been considered a member of the intestinal flora <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">61)</ref> but has received little investigative attention as to its potential role as an infectious agent of gastroenteritis, as opposed to its known role as a cause of toxigenic gastroenteristis, wherein ingestion of preformed staphylococcal enterotoxins in contaminated food, and not the presence of the organism in the gut, is known to cause disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>. Moreover, the difficulties encountered with analyzing gastrointestinedwelling microbial communities in situ in healthy individuals, along with the instability of these biofilm structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>, have resulted in little research concerning the formation of S. aureus biofilms in the intestine and their potential role in normal tissue function or transition to disease. Despite this, there is much to be gained from studying the structure and function of S. aureus biofilms in the gastrointestinal tract, including expanding our understanding of the mechanisms regulating virulence, as well as potentially targeting critical components necessary for biofilm formation, as has been previously proposed for staphylococcal vaccine development <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(25)</ref>.</p><p>The low levels of fluid shear created by the RWV are physiologically relevant to the brush border of the intestines <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref> and trigger S. aureus attachment-independent biofilms, demonstrated by copious amounts of EPS completely encasing LSMMG-cultured bacterial cells and a corresponding increase in antibiotic resistance. Alterations of bacterial biofilm characteristics in response to the low fluid shear in the LSMMG environment have been previously demonstrated. Culture in the RWV resulted in self-aggregation and increased alginate production of P. aeruginosa and conferred a phenotype consistent with reported cystic fibrosis pathology in the lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13)</ref>. Additionally, Escherichia coli attached to glass microcarrier beads generated thicker and more resistant biofilms when cultivated under LSMMG conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(38)</ref>. Taken together, a lowfluid-shear environment stimulates increased EPS production by multiple microorganisms. If the enhanced mucoidy produced by S. aureus N315 at low fluid shear levels reflects a response comparable to the response during colonization of low fluid shear niches in the intestinal tract, then the RWV system may provide a model of intestinal, mucus-associated biofilms.</p><p>Matrix-enclosed bacterial cells in an attached biofilm experience different environmental conditions than if growing planktonically <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(60)</ref>. The environment within an extracellular matrix has been characterized as having low oxygen tension and limited nutrient availability, resulting in altered microbial metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(45)</ref>. Using microarray analysis, we were able to identify increased expression profiles correlating to 17 ORFs. Biochemically, the protein products of many of these genes can be connected to a fermentative metabolism, as formate acetyltransferase, D-lactate dehydrogenase, and alcohol dehydrogenase were upregulated in response to low-fluid-shear culture. The alignment of the predicted regulatory regions of LSMMGresponsive genes revealed two conserved consensus sequences: t/aTGTGA t/a 6 TCACAt/a and GTTTa/ta/t 12-15 GGGa/tAa/t. The first sequence is a binding site for the redox-sensing transcriptional repressor Rex <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(51)</ref>. The Rex repressor is a sensor of the intracellular NADH/NAD ϩ redox balance, and it is considered a key regulator of anaerobic metabolism in S. aureus.</p><p>The binding of Rex to NADH leads to the derepression of genes whose protein products are involved in fermentative respiration, which regenerates the NAD ϩ pool <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(51)</ref>. The increased expression of genes under the control of Rex is consistent with the conditions associated within a biofilm. The second consensus sequence is a binding site for the alternate sigma factor SigB <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(22)</ref>. SigB is a global regulator involved in the differential regulation of over 200 staphylococcal genes upon entrance into stationary phase and in response to various environmental stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>. Therefore, it is not surprising that genes under its control were upregulated. The role of SigB in biofilm formation, however, remains under debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69)</ref>. Furthermore, 8 of the 17 LSMMG-responsive ORFs have been reported to be upregulated in biofilm cultures of S. aureus compared to planktonic culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(60)</ref>. Taken together, the data from the microarray analysis support the phenotypic data that the LSMMG cultures respond to the low-shear environment by initiating a biofilm phenotype.</p><p>Interestingly, our microarray results indicated upregulation of the gene encoding the ATP-dependent protease ClpL. This is notable, as Rosado et al. documented the increase of this gene in response to LSMMG culture as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref>. Furthermore, Clp proteases have been implicated in the LSMMG response of Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71)</ref>. The functional role of ClpL in S. aureus is unknown, as is the role of this family of proteases in response to the LSMMG environment, but it warrants further investigation.</p><p>For their role as potential regulators of the LSMMG response, the expression levels of rex, sigB, cspA, and hfq were investigated. As previously described, Rex and Sig B are both transcriptional regulators whose consensus binding sites were noted in the regulatory region of multiple LSMMG-induced ORFs. CspA, the major cold shock protein in S. aureus, also functions as an RNA chaperone and has been implicated in pigment production <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(29)</ref>. The RNA chaperone Hfq has been directly associated with the mechanism governing the LSMMG response in both S. Typhimurium and P. aeruginosa <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72)</ref>. Despite the increase in expression of genes under the control of Rex and SigB, no significant difference in their expression levels in response to LSMMG was found. This was true for CspA as well. However, a 2.68-fold decrease in the expression of Hfq was observed. The role of Hfq in S. aureus is currently the subject of much debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">36)</ref>; however, Liu et al., through the construction of an hfq mutant, showed that Hfq can function as a global regulator in S. aureus <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref>. Comparing our results with the work by Liu et al. revealed that 7 of our 17 LSMMG-upregulated genes were also upregulated in response to an hfq mutation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref>. Furthermore, 9 of our 17 LSMMG-upregulated genes were reported by Liu et al. to bind Hfq <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(36)</ref>. Interestingly, the work by Liu et al. indicated that mutation of hfq affected pigment production and resulted in an overall decrease in virulence, which strongly correlates with our work, further suggesting that Hfq is involved in the lowshear response of S. aureus. As the RNA isolation technique was not optimal for the recovery of small RNAs and as the arrays used did not contain probes to the coding sequences of such genes, it is possible that Hfq, along with other RNA chaperones and/or small noncoding RNAs, govern the LSSMG response via classical regulators, such as Rex and SigB. More importantly, this is the first report identifying an Hfq response to low-fluid-shear conditions in a Gram-positive microorganism. This association in S. aureus, in addition to previously reported responses of Gram-negative organisms, strongly suggests that the ability to sense and respond to mechanical stimuli is evolutionarily conserved among structurally diverse prokaryotes.</p><p>Growth of S. aureus N315 under low-fluid-shear conditions resulted in decreased levels of the pigmented carotenoid staphyloxanthin, a nonessential, secondary metabolite <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(56)</ref>. Staphyloxanthin is produced through the mevalonate biosynthetic pathway, which requires acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(6)</ref>. The observed phenotype of a decrease in staphyloxanthin production supports our microarray data, which suggest a fermentative metabolism where pyruvate is shunted to support fermentative respiration and less acetyl-CoA enters the mevalonate pathway. It also follows that any available acetyl-CoA would be preferentially utilized for the synthesis of vital isoprenoids.</p><p>For the microorganisms thus far examined, the effect of the LSMMG environment on growth kinetics is varied, including reports of the low-shear condition having no effect or resulting in higher concentrations of bacteria than in controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73)</ref>. When cultured under LSMMG conditions in a nutrient-rich broth, S. Typhimurium 3339 displayed nearly identical growth profiles to those of the control through the mid-log growth phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(49)</ref>. However, when cultured in a minimal salts medium, a marked increase in concentrations of the LSMMGcultured bacteria compared to the control was noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(73)</ref>. E. coli ATCC 26 has demonstrated an opposite effect, growing to higher concentrations in a nutrient-rich medium under LSMMG conditions yet revealing no difference in growth profiles when cultured in a minimal medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(5)</ref>. As staphylococci have complex nutritional requirements, Rosado et al. used a nutrient-rich growth medium and reported no significant difference in growth between LSMMG and control cultures of three methicillin-susceptible S. aureus clinical isolates, RF1, RF6, and RF11 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(62)</ref>. However, when using a nutrient-rich medium in our studies, we noted an approximately 3-fold difference in the cell concentrations of MRSA strain N315 and a difference of more than 5-fold for the MSSA strain 8325. Additionally, in response to LSMMG culturing in minimal medium, E. coli ZK650 exhibited increased growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(19)</ref>, whereas under the same conditions, E. coli strains AIEC 083:H1 and K-12 AMS6 displayed growth profiles similar to those of controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">71)</ref>. Taken together, it is most likely that changes in growth kinetics in response to LSMMG culture conditions occur on a strain-specific basis. Moreover, this study is the first to report a decrease in total cell concentration over time in response to culturing in the LSMMG environment. While the cause of this decreased growth is unclear, it may result from the heavy mucoidy and biofilm characteristics previously described.</p><p>Although similarities exist between the low-fluid-shear responses of S. aureus and previously documented Gram-negative organisms, there appears to be a basic fundamental difference in virulence properties. Whereas S. Typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and pathogenic E. coli have all shown increased virulence and/or virulence characteristics when cultured in LSMMG <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">48)</ref>, S. aureus appears to favor a phenotype consistent with colonization rather than initiation of infection. This difference is exemplified by the decrease in carotenoid production in S. aureus N315. Staphyloxanthin functions as a protective coat that shields the bacterium from the deleterious effects of reactive oxygen species associated with the human immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(35)</ref>. In our studies, the low-fluid-shear-cultured, unpigmented bacteria were significantly more susceptible to killing by both oxidative stress and the immune components present in human whole blood than respective pigmented control cultures. S. Typhimurium and invasive pathogenic E. coli, both enteric pathogens, are among the most significant causes of bacterial gastroenteritis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(43)</ref>, due, in part, to their ability to traverse the mucus layer and consequently interact with the underlying intestinal epithelium. Additionally, both have the potential to actively invade intestinal epithelial cells, affording themselves a protective environment in which to replicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21)</ref>. As S. aureus does not benefit from invasion of intestinal epithelial cells, it follows that S. aureus may well colonize the low-fluid-shear environment in the mucosa near the surface of epithelial cells, establishing a biofilm phenotype.</p><p>While some of the responses of S. aureus parallel those from the most thoroughly documented Gram-negative organisms to low fluid shear, such as the involvement of Hfq, the microbial response appears to differ based upon the benefit toward each individual microorganism's ability to proliferate. Contrary to previous reports of the response of enhanced virulence characteristics in several Gram-negative organisms, S. aureus initiates a biofilm/colonization phenotype that alters its metabolism, slows its growth, and downregulates virulence characteristics. This response could potentially benefit S. aureus within the gastrointestinal tract and possibly other mucosal host sites, where it would experience low levels of fluid shear. Further analysis of this low-shear response in S. aureus holds the potential to provide critical insight into key environmental factors influencing the divergence between infection and colonization during the initial host-pathogen interaction.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>FIG. 2.
