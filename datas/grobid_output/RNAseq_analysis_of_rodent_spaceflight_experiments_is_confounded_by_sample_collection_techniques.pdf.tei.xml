<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To understand the physiological changes that occur in response to spaceflight, mice are transported to the International Space Station (ISS) and housed for variable periods of time before euthanasia on-orbit or return to Earth. Sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. We found large changes in the transcriptome of mouse tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved, and dissected after return to Earth. Changes due to preservation method eclipsed those between flight and ground samples, making it difficult to identify spaceflight-specific changes. Follow-on experiments to interrogate the roles of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods suggested that differences due to preservation protocols are exacerbated when coupled with polyA selection. This has important implications for the interpretation of existing datasets and the design of future experiments.</p><p>We previously showed, using transcriptomic, proteomic, and immunohistochemical data from the Rodent Research-1 (RR-1), Rodent Research-3 (RR-3), and Space Transportation System (STS)-135 missions, that lipotoxic pathways are activated in rodent liver in two different strains of mice that were flown for as long as 42 days in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Beheshti et al., 2019)</ref>. Because animals in the RR-1 and RR-3 experiments were euthanized in space, this work suggested that space alone was the most likely cause for similar changes previously observed in liver samples from mice flown during the STS-135 experiments where animals returned alive</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Spaceflight places multiple stresses upon the human body including altered gravity fields and exposure to cosmic radiation, which lead to health risks for spacefaring humans (Institute of <ref type="bibr">Medicine, 2008)</ref>. Decades of research on astronauts has begun to reveal how humans respond to the spaceflight environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019)</ref> but physiological monitoring of astronauts is still limited. Thus, rodent models have been essential for advancing our understanding of how mammals-including humans-respond to spaceflight. This includes the impact of spaceflight on muscle structure <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Shen et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Spatz et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tascher et al., 2017)</ref>, liver <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Beheshti et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Jonscher et al., 2016)</ref>, and immune functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Pecaut et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rettig et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Ward et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Despite success of the rodent model, sample collection under such difficult conditions introduces confounding factors that need to be identified and addressed. These are related to hardware limitations, small sample size, and severe restraints on astronaut crew availability. Successful experiments must work within these constraints to produce meaningful insights. In response, the first Rodent Research (RR) mission established new capabilities for conducting reliable long-duration experiments using rodents with on-orbit sample collection. Animals can either be euthanized onboard the ISS or returned to Earth alive. Both approaches introduce confounding factors. The former is experimentally challenging but preserves the sample during exposure to microgravity, whereas the latter exposes the animal to re-entry stresses, and sampling occurs only after a variable lag between landing and euthanasia-essentially sampling re-adaptation to Earth conditions in addition to the response to spaceflight. Inconsistent handling of samples necessitates a clear understanding of how dissection and preservation protocols affect downstream data generation.</p><p>to Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Jonscher et al., 2016)</ref>. The lipotoxic effect is stronger with duration and may have ramifications for astronauts' health during long missions. This analysis did not include two flight and two ground animals from RR-1, as these animals were dissected immediately after euthanasia on-orbit as opposed to the rest, which were first returned to Earth as intact frozen carcasses for later dissection.</p><p>Here we now compare RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) datasets generated from livers preserved using these distinct protocols (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). We find large changes in the transcriptome of tissues dissected and preserved on-orbit compared with tissues from mice euthanized on-orbit, preserved intact by freezing on-orbit, and dissected after return to Earth. To identify and mediate how the preservation method could have such a large effect on differential gene expression (DGE) results, we performed follow-on experiments to interrogate the role of euthanasia methods, tissue and carcass preservation protocols, and library preparation methods on DGE changes. Our findings have important implications for interpreting existing datasets and the design of future experiments.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Preservation Method Is the Primary Driver of Gene Expression Variance in RR-1 Liver Samples</head><p>To assess gene expression differences in liver samples from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cadena et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Globus and Galazka, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ronca et al., 2019)</ref>, RNA was extracted from livers dissected from spaceflight (FLT) and ground control (GC) animals either immediately after euthanasia (immediate preservation, I) or from frozen carcasses after partial thawing (carcass preservation, C) and sequenced following polyA selection (Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed preservation method (C versus I) as the primary driver of variance among samples rather than spaceflight (FLT versus GC) (Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Furthermore, there was an order of magnitude difference in the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified in FLT versus GC carcass samples than was observed in FLT versus GC immediate samples, and only 4 DEGs overlapped between the two preservation methods (Figure <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Gene set enrichment analysis of FLT versus GC immediate-(Figure <ref type="figure">2A</ref>) and carcass-derived (Figure <ref type="figure">2B</ref>) samples showed no overlap in enriched gene ontology (GO) terms (Figure <ref type="figure">2C</ref>), showing that any gene expression changes in the liver as a result of spaceflight exposure were confounded by the sample preservation method used.</p><p>Since livers from only 2 FLT and 2 GC animals in the RR-1 NASA Validation mission were preserved via the immediate method, RNA from livers prepared via the immediate method from two additional studies, the RR-1 CASIS mission (Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cadena et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Globus et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Ronca et al., 2019)</ref> and a groundbased preservation and storage study (Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Choi et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">GeneLab, 2016)</ref>, were also sequenced following polyA selection. Despite multiple different experimental factors in RR-1 NASA, RR-1 CASIS, and the ground-based preservation studies, PCA continued to show preservation method as the primary driver of variance among samples in these datasets (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S3</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Carcass-Preserved Samples Exhibit Less Uniform Transcript Coverage than Immediate-Preserved Samples</head><p>To further investigate the observed differences in preservation method, RR-1 NASA FLT and GC liver samples derived from the carcass preservation method were grouped together (C) and FLT and GC liver samples derived from the immediate preservation method were grouped together (I). DGE was evaluated in carcass versus immediate samples. Many more genes were differentially expressed in carcass versus immediate samples (2,934 DEGs) than in either FLT-C versus GC-C (619 DEGs) or in FLT-I versus GC-I (67 DEGs) samples, further supporting preservation method as the primary driver of variance in RR-1 NASA liver samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3A</ref>). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that several of the gene ontologies enriched in carcass samples (when compared with immediate samples) involved RNA regulation and processing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3B</ref>). Despite similarly high RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S4</ref>), carcass samples exhibited significantly less 5 0 to 3 0 gene body coverage than immediate samples as indicated by their 5 0 to 3 0 transcript integrity ratios. The 5 0 to 3 0 transcript integrity ratios were determined by dividing the percent coverage indicated in the 5 0 -shaded region by that in the 3 0 -shaded region for each sample (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3C</ref> and <ref type="figure">D</ref>).</p><p>Expression of Genes Involved in 5 0 -Methylguanosine Decapping and PolyA Removal Is Affected by Preservation Condition data. In mammals, eight genes have decapping activity in vitro and/or in cells: Dcp2 (Nudt20), Nudt3, Nudt16, Nudt2, Nudt12, Nudt15, Nudt17, Nudt19. In addition, Dxo acts on partially capped mRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grudzien-Nogalska and Kiledjian, 2017)</ref>. Two of these genes-Dxo and Nudt2-were significantly more expressed in the carcass samples, whereas another two-Nudt15 and Dcp2 (Nudt20)-were significantly more expressed in immediate samples (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S5</ref>). Removal of polyA tails from mRNA is catalyzed by two complexes. The first, CCR4-NOT, consists of CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CNOT9, CNOT10, CNOT6, CNOT6L, CNOT7, and CNOT8. The second, PAN2-PAN3, consists of PAN2 and PAN3 (Siwaszek  <ref type="bibr">et al., 2014)</ref>. In the case of the 10 subunit CCR4-NOT complex, we observed 5 genes that were more highly expressed in the immediate group (Cnot1, Cnot2, Cnot9, Cnot6, Cnot6L) and 3 that were more highly expressed in the carcass group (Cnot3, Cnot10, Cnot7) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3E</ref>). In the case of the PAN2-PAN3 complex, both Pan2 and Pan3 were more highly expressed in the carcass group (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3E</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Samples Sequenced Following Ribodepletion Exhibit More Uniform Transcript Coverage than Samples Prepared with PolyA Selection</head><p>The polyA selection library preparation method, which was initially used to evaluate gene expression differences in RR-1 NASA Validation mission liver samples, requires intact RNA to minimize bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kumar et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Petrova et al., 2017)</ref>. Because our data suggest that the carcass samples were more degraded than the immediate samples <ref type="bibr">(Figures 3C and 3D)</ref>, the total RNA isolated from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission carcass liver samples was used to prepare libraries with the ribodepletion method to minimize transcript integrity bias, then re-sequenced. PCA showed a more distinct separation of FLT and GC carcass samples when the samples were prepared via the ribodepletion method (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4A</ref>) than by polyA selection (FLT-C and GC-C samples in Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). DEGs were identified in FLT versus GC carcass samples prepared with the ribodepletion method and compared with those from polyA-prepared carcass samples. Although hundreds of DEGs in FLT versus GC carcass samples overlap between ribodepleted and polyA-prepared samples, more DEGs were identified in FLT versus GC samples prepared with the ribodepletion method (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4B</ref>), suggesting this method may be more sensitive. There was no overlap of enriched gene ontology terms in FLT versus GC samples processed by ribodepletion and polyA enrichment (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4D</ref>).</p><p>Next, transcript integrity was evaluated in the ribodepletion-prepared FLT and GC carcass samples and compared with polyA-selection-prepared carcass samples. Samples prepared with the polyA selection method exhibited less coverage of the 5 0 portion of transcripts compared with ribodepletion-prepared samples (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4E</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4F</ref>). Thus, ribodepletion was used to further investigate the effects of preservation method (Carcass versus Immediate) on gene-expression in a ground-based tissue preservation study.</p></div>

In addition to liver samples, we also analyzed quadriceps to determine whether sample preservation methods also confounded DGE analysis in this tissue.</p><p>Mice of the same age, sex, strain, and source as those used in the RR-1 NASA Validation mission were used in the ground-based tissue preservation study. Mice were evenly divided into one of six groups as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S6</ref>. The mice in groups 1-4 were euthanized with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol) as in RR-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Choi et al., 2020)</ref>, then subjected to various preservation protocols to evaluate the phenomena observed in RR-1 NASA carcass and immediate liver samples. Livers and quadriceps were dissected immediately after euthanasia from mice in group 1. These tissues were divided into thirds and preserved in one of three ways: (1) freezing in dry ice to mimic the cold stowage container that was used to freeze the immediate liver samples in the RR-1 mission, (2) submersion in LN2, or (3) with RNAlater. After preservation, all tissues were stored at À80 C until further processing.</p><p>Although it is a common practice to dissect mice immediately after euthanasia, due to limitations in crew time for spaceflight experiments, immediate dissection is not always possible.

Similar to RR-1 carcass and immediate samples (Figures <ref type="figure">1A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S3</ref>), the dry ice-preserved carcass and immediate samples, which mimic the RR-1 preservation conditions, clustered away from each other, albeit to a much lesser degree than that observed with the polyA-prepared RR-1 samples (Figure <ref type="figure">5A</ref>). Furthermore, the dry-icepreserved carcass samples exhibited less 5 0 gene body coverage than the dry-ice-preserved immediate samples (Figure <ref type="figure">5B</ref>). Although this observation is consistent with that observed in RR-1 carcass and immediate samples (prepared using the polyA selection method) (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3D</ref>), the difference was less dramatic. Therefore, using the ribodepletion method appears to partially alleviate the differences observed in transcript integrity between carcass and immediate samples.</p></div>

Only a few genes were differentially expressed between livers dissected immediately and preserved on dry ice, in RNAlater, or in LN2 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S3</ref>). Similarly, pairwise gene set enrichment analysis showed no significantly enriched GO terms between these tissue preservation methods (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S3</ref>), suggesting that for immediately dissected livers, the tissue preservation method had minimal impact on gene expression. Livers dissected from slow (dry ice) frozen carcasses, which most closely mimics the carcass preservation method used in RR-1 NASA Validation and several other RR missions (including RR-3 and Rodent Research-6), exhibited the most DEGs when compared with immediately dissected livers preserved in either LN2 or RNAlater (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and <ref type="table">S4</ref>, respectively). In contrast, livers dissected from carcasses preserved in either RNAlater or LN2 exhibited hundreds fewer DEGs when compared with immediately dissected livers preserved in either LN2 or RNAlater (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> and <ref type="table">S4</ref>, respectively). These data indicate that carcass segmentation and preservation in RNAlater or preserving carcasses by submersion in LN2 more closely mimic the common preservation methods used in terrestrial laboratories, than does the slow freeze carcass preservation method used in the RR-1 NASA Validation study.</p></div>

Gene Expression and Transcript Integrity Analysis of Preservation Methods for Liver and Quadriceps Samples Liver and quadriceps samples were dissected from mice immediately after euthanasia with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol) then preserved in dry ice (I_DI), liquid nitrogen (I_LN2), or RNAlater (I_RNAlat) before RNAseq analysis. Alternatively, liver and quadriceps samples were dissected from partially thawed frozen carcasses of mice that were euthanized with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol) and then preserved in dry ice (C_DI), liquid nitrogen (C_LN2), or segmented into thirds and preserved in RNAlater (C_RNAlat) before RNAseq analysis. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The Impact of Preservation Method on Gene Expression Is Tissue Dependent</head><p>To determine if the observed differences in gene expression due to carcass preservation method are unique to the liver, gene expression and transcript integrity were also evaluated in quadriceps from mice in groups 1-4 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S6</ref> and Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S2</ref>). PCA showed more overlap among carcass and immediate quadriceps samples (Figure <ref type="figure">5C</ref>) than among carcass and immediate liver samples (Figure <ref type="figure">5A</ref>), suggesting that gene expression in the quadriceps is less sensitive to preservation methods. Unlike liver samples, almost no significant differences were observed in 5 0 to 3 0 gene body coverage in quadriceps samples prepared using different preservation methods (Figure <ref type="figure">5D</ref>). Fewer DEGs were identified in carcass versus immediate quadriceps samples than carcass versus immediate liver samples for almost every preservation method tested (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref>, <ref type="table">S5</ref>, and S6), further supporting that gene expression in the quadriceps is less sensitive to different types of preservation methods. Although there are fewer differences over-all, similar to what was observed in liver samples, cutting the carcass into thirds and then preserving in RNAlater resulted in the fewest DEGs when compared with immediate dissection followed by tissue preservation in LN2 or RNAlater (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">3</ref> and <ref type="table">S6</ref>, respectively).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene Expression in Select Tissues Was Not Affected by the Method of Euthanasia</head><p>Because the most common euthanasia method used in RR missions to date is intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine/xylazine and the most common euthanasia method used in standard laboratories is CO 2 inhalation, these methods were used to euthanize mice in groups 5 and 6, respectively, to determine if euthanasia method is another confounding variable that could affect gene expression in select tissues (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S6</ref>, Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S2</ref>). Gene expression was evaluated in livers and quadriceps dissected from mice in groups 2, 5, and 6 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S7A-S7D</ref>). PCA showed no distinct differences in global gene expression in liver (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S7A</ref>) or quadriceps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S7B</ref>) samples dissected from mice euthanized with different methods. Pairwise differential gene expression analysis and gene set enrichment analysis also identified few, if any, DEGs and enriched GO terms among liver (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S7C</ref>) and quadriceps (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S7D</ref>) samples. These data suggest that the types of euthanasia methods evaluated here do not impact gene expression in select tissues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Herein, we show that protocols used to preserve mouse carcasses on-orbit have large effects on gene expression patterns as measured by RNAseq. Indeed, changes in gene expression due to preservation condition overwhelmed those due to spaceflight. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that many GO terms enriched due to carcass preservation were involved in RNA processing. This correlated with reduced transcript integrity (relatively poor coverage of the 5 0 end of transcripts) in samples from carcasses preserved on-orbit when these were sequenced with a polyA enrichment RNAseq protocol.</p><p>Although RNAseq following polyA selection can more efficiently quantify gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Kumar et al., 2017)</ref>, ribodepletion methods are more effective on degraded RNA samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Li et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Schuierer et al., 2017)</ref>. However, although the RNA used in this study was of good quality (RIN &gt;7), we observed a severe bias in transcript coverage following polyA selection depending upon the tissue preservation condition utilized. Specifically, samples taken from carcasses that were slow-frozen on-orbit exhibited a lower 5 0 to 3 0 coverage ratio as compared with samples taken from immediately dissected tissues. Although resequencing of the carcass flight samples with a ribodepletion protocol produced a more even 5 0 to 3 0 coverage ratio, our follow-on studies that directly compared slow carcass freezing with immediate dissection revealed a similar (albeit reduced) 5 0 to 3 0 coverage bias. Taken together, this suggests that slow carcass freezing causes transcript degradation that in-turn leads to reduced 5 0 coverage.</p><p>mRNA degradation starts with the removal of the polyA tail, at which point degradation continues either from the 3 0 end via the exosome complex or the 5 0 end following removal of the 5 0 -methylguanosine cap. Deadenylation of cytoplasmic mRNA is the rate-limiting step in mRNA degradation and is catalyzed by one of two complexes: the CCR4-NOT complex, which consists of 10 subunits (CNOT1, CNOT2, CNOT3, CNOT4, CNOT6, CNOT6l, CNOT7, CNOT8, CNOT9, CNOT10), and the PAN2-PAN3 deadenylation complex consisting of two subunits (PAN2, PAN3) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Siwaszek et al., 2014)</ref>. We observed transcriptional changes to multiple subunits in each of these complexes when comparing carcass and immediate samples. Most striking was the coordinated upregulation of both Pan2 and Pan3 in the carcass samples from the RR-1 NASA Validation mission, which suggests an increase in PAN2-PAN3 deadenylation activity, which could result in loss of polyA tails in some transcripts. This could lead to poor mRNA capture by our polyA enrichment protocol and result in some of the differences seen between the polyA enrichment and ribodepletion protocols.</p><p>Three proteins-Dcp2 (Nudt20), Nudt3, Nudt16-have decapping activity both in vitro and in cells, whereas an additional five-Nudt2, Nudt12, Nudt15, Nudt17, Nudt19-have decapping activity in vitro.</p><p>In addition, the Dxo family of proteins acts on partially capped mRNAs (Grudzien-Nogalska and Kiledjian, 2017). Although regulation of these proteins is complex and involves subcellular localization and post- translation modification, we observed evidence for altered expression of these decapping enzymes: Dxo and Nudt2 were more abundant in carcass samples, whereas Nudt15 and Dcp2 (Nudt20) were more abundant in immediate samples. Although these changes are not coordinated, they do point to altered decapping activity within the carcass samples. As decapping precedes mRNA degradation via the 5 0 exonuclease, XRN1, this could alternatively explain the relatively poor 5 0 transcript coverage seen in both polyA enriched and ribodepleted carcass liver samples. Additional experimentation will be necessary to confirm the changes to decapping and deadenylation enzymes seen here and to understand their role in the 5 0 to 3 0 coverage bias observed.</p><p>We observed a marked difference in the 5 0 to 3 0 coverage bias between liver and quadriceps samples.</p><p>Although liver samples were sensitive to carcass preservation via slow-or snap-freeze, quadriceps samples were not. There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, it could be due to the surface exposure of the quadriceps, which would lead to more rapid quenching of biochemical processes. Second, inherent differences in the transcript pool, mRNA half-lives, and enzymatic complement of liver and quadriceps could offer a biological answer. Although we cannot distinguish between these mechanisms, our observations are consistent with previous results showing that postmortem changes to mRNA is tissue dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Inoue et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Lee et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Miyatake et al., 2004)</ref>.</p><p>The poor transcript integrity in slow-frozen carcasses sequenced with a polyA enrichment protocol was not evident in pre-sequencing QC analyses. Indeed, all samples had RIN values &gt;7, and there was no correlation between the gene expression differences and RIN. This distinguishes our results from previous studies showing a strong correlation between RIN values and loss of 5 0 coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Davila et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Sigurgeirsson et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, additional pre-sequencing QC analyses capable of detecting these issues would be useful. Low throughput sequencing is rapid, decreasing in cost, and being adopted as a QC step but does not provide the coverage necessary to detect the biases seen here.</p><p>Alternatively, if effective pre-sequencing QC metrics cannot be developed, a number of analytical approaches could be utilized. In one category are methods that calculate additional metrics such as mRIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Feng et al., 2015)</ref> and TIN <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wang et al., 2016)</ref> to allow assessment of transcript integrity and exclusion of problematic samples. In a second category are processes that account for variable transcript integrity by considering only reads that occur near the 3 0 end of transcripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Sigurgeirsson et al., 2014)</ref>, controlling for the effects of RIN using a linear model framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gallego Romero et al., 2014)</ref>, or by calculating idealized coverage curves on a gene-by-gene basis and using these for normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Xiong et al., 2019)</ref>. Additional analyses are necessary to determine if these approaches can mitigate the issue observed here.</p><p>Although we do not have a complete picture of the mechanisms resulting in the apparent gene expression change resulting from slow carcass freezing, we were able to identify effective mitigation strategies (our suggestions are summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>). Foremost among these is the utilization of a ribodepletion protocol in place of polyA enrichment. In this study, ribodepletion resulted in more even gene body coverage and was not as sensitive to slow freezing of carcasses. This is in agreement with previous studies that found that ribodepletion is less prone to bias introduced by poor RNA quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Li et al., 2014)</ref> and less prone to 3 0 coverage bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Schuierer et al., 2017)</ref>. Beyond this, we found that two carcass preservation methods generated acceptable results, with few DEGs and enriched GO terms when compared with the immediate dissection of tissues and preservation in liquid nitrogen-the de facto gold standard. The first is rapid freeze of carcasses in liquid nitrogen and subsequent storage at À80 C, followed by partial thaw, dissection, and tissue preservation in liquid nitrogen. Although this led to some loss of 5 0 transcript coverage, it had the fewest DEGs (515, adj. p &lt; 0.05 &amp; |Log2 FC| &gt; 1.5) and no enriched GO terms (FDR &lt;0.25, NOM &lt;0.01) when compared with immediate dissection. Alternatively, segmentation of carcasses and immersion in RNAlater and subsequent storage at À80 C, followed by partial thaw, dissection, and tissue preservation in liquid nitrogen resulted in better maintenance of 5 0 transcript coverage but an increased number of DEGs (1952, adj. p &lt; 0.05 &amp; |Log2 FC| &gt; 1.5), although no GO terms were enriched (FDR &lt;0.25, NOM &lt;0.01). As euthanasia protocols can change serum biomarkers <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Pierozan et al., 2017)</ref> and mRNA expression levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Staib-Lasarzik et al., 2014)</ref>, we were reassured to find that the euthanasia protocols used here did not affect gene expression in liver or quadriceps.</p><p>To conclude, our results indicate that care must be taken in choosing sample preservation protocols that preserve transcriptional patterns and other embedded information but that are also feasible in resourceconstrained environments such as those found in space.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations of the Study</head><p>This study directly assessed the effects of preservation protocols on mouse liver and quadriceps, thus extrapolation to other tissues should be done with caution. Moreover, this study is not capable of identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed effects, and additional experimentation is required to confirm that the changes to decapping enzyme expression are responsible for changes in transcript integrity and apparent gene expression.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spaceflight Mission</head><p>Rodent Research-1 (RR-1) was the first mission in which animals were maintained on the ISS for a long duration mission in the Rodent Habitat modified from heritage Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) hardware. Complete details were published previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Choi et al., 2020)</ref>. In short, RR-1 consisted of two experiments: ISS National Lab study (RR-1 CASIS) and NASA Validation study (RR-1 NASA). In the ISS National Lab Study, ten 32-week-old female C57BL/6NTac mice (Taconic Biosciences, Rensselaer, NY) were flown to space for 20-21 days then euthanized via IP of pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ) and dissected onboard the ISS. Livers were dissected then inserted into cryovials, which were then frozen in a cold stowage container that was pre-chilled to -130 °C transferring to the Minus Eighty-Degree Laboratory Freezer (MELFI) at the end of each dissection session (-80 °C). In the NASA Validation study, ten 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar harbor, ME) were flown to the ISS for 37 before euthanasia and subsequent dissection. Due to crew time constraint, only two (out of ten) mice were dissected immediately after euthanasia via IP injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ) to recover spleen and liver tissues on the ISS. Isolated livers were preserved by using the same method as the ISS National Lab study livers. The remaining eight animals were euthanized, then intact carcasses were wrapped in aluminum foil, put in Ziploc bags, placed in a pre-chilled cold stowage container and stored in the MELFI. For both the ISS National Lab study and the NASA Validation there were respective cohorts of age-matched basal animals which were euthanized one day after as a baseline control as well as age-matched ground control animals kept in ISS Environmental Simulator at Kennedy Space (KSC) on a delay to mimic spaceflight conditions. In addition, the NASA Validation study also had a of age-matched vivarium control animals that were housed in the vivarium cages and followed the same experimental timeline and process as the spaceflight animals. A timeline indicating major events in the RR-1 mission is shown in Figure <ref type="figure">S1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample Collection</head><p>The frozen intact carcasses from the NASA Validation study were partially thawed then dissected at NASA Ames Research Center upon return to Earth. One lobe of liver from each carcass was removed, immediately homogenized in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) followed by snap freezing the tissue homogenates in LN2. Quadriceps were snap frozen upon collection. Tissues were stored at -80 °C until extraction.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNA Isolation</head><p>RNA was isolated from all liver and quadriceps samples using the following methods. For the liver samples, RNA was extracted with the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, homogenization buffer was made by adding 1:100 volume ratio of betamercaptoethanol to RLT buffer and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was cut using a sterile scalpel and immediately placed in 800 µL of the RLT buffer solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer's protocol including on-column DNase treatment with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 µL RNase-and DNase-free H2O per elution. For quadriceps samples, RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and the isolated RNA samples were then treated on column with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Concentration and absorbance ratios of all the isolated liver and quadriceps RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).</p><p>Library Preparation and RNA-Sequencing</p><p>Samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 6 or above were sent to the University of California (UC), Davis Genome Center where the libraries were constructed, and RNA-sequencing was performed. All the RR-1 RNA-sequencing data analyzed in this manuscript were obtained from the NASA GeneLab Data Repository (<ref type="url" target="https://genelab.nasa.gov/">https://genelab.nasa.gov/</ref>), including GLDS-47, GLDS-48, and GLDS-168. The RR-1 liver RNA samples were sequenced twice. First, libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA library prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) after polyA selection, and sequencing was done with 50 bp single end reads on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform (GLDS-47 and GLDS-48). Second, selected RNA samples were spiked in with ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) before shipping to the UC Davis Genome Center. Ribosomal RNA was removed with the Illumina RiboZero Gold ribodepletion kit then RNA sequencing libraries were constructed using the KAPA RNA HyperPrep kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and the sequencing was done with 150 bp paired end reads on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (GLDS-168).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ground-based Tissue Preservation Study</head><p>Animals 20-to 21-week-old female C57BL/6J mice (Jackson laboratories, Bar harbor, ME) were shipped to the NASA Ames Research Center Animal Care Facility and were randomly housed in the standard vivarium cages with up to five mice per cage. The animals were acclimated for five days before the start of procedures to ensure recovery from the transportation stress. During acclimation, the animals were maintained on a 12h light/dark cycle and were provided with standard chow and water access ad libitum. One day before euthanasia, animal body weights were measured and used to distribute the animals into six groups (n=6/group) with similar average body weights. Animal health status, water and food intake were monitored daily.</p><p>The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011) and was approved on February 8, 2018 by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at NASA Ames Research Center (Protocol number NAS-17-006-Y1). Animal Euthanasia and Dissection</p><p>The detailed descriptions and rationale of each group are as follows as well as outlined in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S6</ref> and Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">S2</ref>. Group 1 (M1-M6) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ) (80 mg in 0.2 ml) (Virbac, West Lake, TX) followed by cervical dislocation. Dissection was performed immediately after euthanasia without freezing the carcasses. Left lobes of livers and quadriceps were subdivided into three sections and each tissue section was preserved either by freezing on dry ice, snap freezing in liquid nitrogen, or preserved in RNAlaterÔ solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, WA). For the tissue sections preserved in RNAlaterÔ, tissue sections were submerged in RNAlaterÔ at 4 °C for 3 days then frozen and stored at -80 °C. Note that this is the only group of animals that were dissected upon euthanasia. Carcasses from animals in subsequent groups were preserved intact using various methods then dissected at a later date. Group 1 tissue sections that were preserved by freezing on dry ice most closely mimics the process that was used to generate RR-1 NASA and CASIS immediate samples.</p><p>Group 2 (M7-M12) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ) followed by cervical dislocation. The carcasses were wrapped in foil and preserved by freezing on dry ice, similar to the intact carcass preservation method used for the RR-1 NASA Validation Study. Once frozen, the carcasses were stored at -80 °C. On the day of dissection, mouse carcasses were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes prior to dissection. Left lobes of livers were removed and divided into two: one piece was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80 °C; the other piece was homogenized in RLT buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the tissue homogenate was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80 °C for 70 days before RNA extraction to simulate the process used to generate the RR-1 NASA "carcass" liver samples. This extended storage did not result in a substantial number of DEG (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S7E&amp;F</ref>). Quadriceps were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen after dissection then stored at -80 °C.</p><p>Group 3 (M13-M18) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ) followed by cervical dislocation. The intact carcasses were wrapped in foil and preserved by snap freezing in liquid nitrogen followed by storage at -80 °C. On the day of dissection, mouse carcasses were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes prior to dissection. Left lobes of livers and quadriceps were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80 °C.</p><p>Group 4 (M19-M24) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ) followed by cervical dislocation. The carcasses were sectioned into 3 sections, head, chest, and abdomen with tail removed and discarded and each part was submerged in RNAlaterÔ solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, WA) and placed at 4 °C for 3 days to allow thorough permeation before being stored at -80 °C. On the day of dissection, mouse carcasses were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes prior to dissection. Left lobes of livers and quadriceps were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80 °C. This group was used to simulate the procedure done in the RR-7 mission and to test if gene expression signals could be better preserved using an RNA-specific preservative.</p><p>Group 5 (M25-30) animals were euthanized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine (10mg/mL / 3mg/mL in 0.3mL PBS) followed by cervical dislocation. The intact carcasses were wrapped in foil and preserved by freezing on dry ice then stored at -80 °C. On the day of dissection, mouse carcasses were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes prior to dissection. Left lobes of livers and quadriceps were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80 °C. The euthanasia and preservation methods used in this group mimics the process used to generate RR-3 carcass liver samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Smith et al., 2017)</ref>. Ketamine/xylazine is currently the most common euthanasia method used in RR missions.</p><p>Group 6 (M31-M36) animals were euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by cervical dislocation. The carcasses were wrapped in foil and preserved by freezing on dry ice then stored at -80 °C. On the day of dissection, mouse carcasses were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes prior to dissection. Left lobes of livers and quadriceps were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen then stored at -80 °C. This group represents the euthanasia method commonly used in terrestrial laboratories and was used to evaluate any effects on gene expression due to the drug-induced euthanasia methods that have been used in RR missions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNA Isolation</head><p>RNA was isolated from partial left liver lobe and partial quadriceps muscle tissues using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Briefly, homogenization buffer was made by adding 1:100 volume ratio of beta-mercaptoethanol to RLT buffer and kept on ice until use. On average, 48.85 mg of left liver lobe and 20.08 mg of left or right quadriceps was cut using a sterile scalpel and immediately placed in 600 µL of the RLT buffer solution. Complete tissue dispersion was achieved using the handheld Polytron PT1300D homogenizer with 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate by implementing 20 second homogenization periods at a speed of 20,000 RPM. Homogenized samples were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was treated with RNase-Free DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and eluted in 50 µL of RNase-and DNase-free H2O molecular grade water. RNA concentration was measured using Qubit 3.0 Fluorimeter (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).

Euth=euthanasia by pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ), Ket-Xyl= euthanasia by ketamine/xylazine, CO2=euthanasia by carbon dioxide inhalation, C=tissue dissected from frozen carcass that has been partially thawed, I=tissue dissected immediately after euthanasia, DI=dry ice, LN2=liquid nitrogen, RL=RNAlater™. Liver and quadriceps data are from GLDS-235 and GLDS-236, respectively.</figDesc></figure>

Three groups of livers were included: 1) Liver tissues dissected and frozen on dry ice 25 min after euthanizing with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ) followed by cervical dislocation. At the time of RNA extraction, the liver tissues had been stored at -80 °C for around 1-year; 2) Liver tissues dissected 3 min after euthanizing with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ) followed by cervical dislocation and snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. At the time of RNA extraction, the liver tissues had been stored at -80 °C for around 1-year; 3) Liver tissues dissected 3 minutes after euthanizing with pentobarbital/phenytoin (Euthasol Ò ) followed by cervical dislocation and snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen. At the time of RNA extraction, the liver tissues had been stored at -80 ºC for only 3 days. This group served as a positive control for delayed dissection and long-term storage.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNA Isolation</head><p>RNA was isolated using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, homogenization buffer was made by adding 1:100 volume ratio of betamercaptoethanol to RLT buffer and kept on ice until use. Approximately 30 mg of tissue was cut using a sterile scalpel and immediately placed in 800 µL of the RLT buffer solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at room temperature at 15,000 RPM to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer's protocol including on-column DNase treatment with RNase-free DNase (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA was eluted twice per sample in 30 µL RNase-and DNase-free H2O per elution. Concentration and absorbance ratios were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).</p><p>RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).</p><p>Library Preparation and RNA-Sequencing Samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) of 9 or above were sent to the University of California (UC), Davis Genome Center where the libraries were constructed, and RNA-sequencing was performed. Libraries were generated using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded RNA library prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA) after polyA selection, and sequencing was done with 50 bp single end reads on the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene Set Enrichment Analysis</head><p>Pairwise gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on the normalized counts from select samples in GLDS-48, GLDS-168, GLDS-235, and GLDS-236 using the C5: Gene Ontology (GO) gene set (MSigDB v7.1) as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Subramanian et al., 2005)</ref>. All comparisons were performed using the phenotype permutation, except those involving GLDS-48 immediate samples, which used the gene set permutation due to low sample size. The ranked lists of genes were defined by the signal-to-noise metric, and the statistical significance were determined by 1000 permutations of the gene set. FDR £ 0.25 and FDR £ 0.05 were considered significant for comparisons using the phenotype and gene set permutations, respectively, according to the authors' recommendation.</p><p>Supplemental References</p></div>			</div>
