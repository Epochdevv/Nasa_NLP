<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper Missions into Deep Space are planned this decade. Yet the health consequences of exposure to microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) over years-long missions on indispensable visceral organs such as the kidney are largely unexplored. We performed biomolecular (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic), clinical chemistry (electrolytes, endocrinology, biochemistry) and morphometry (histology, 3D imaging, miRNA-ISH, tissue weights) analyses using samples and datasets available from 11 spaceflight-exposed mouse and 5 human, 1 simulated microgravity rat and 4 simulated GCR-exposed mouse missions. We found that spaceflight induces: 1) renal transporter dephosphorylation which may indicate astronauts' increased risk of nephrolithiasis is in part a primary renal phenomenon rather than solely a secondary consequence of bone loss; 2) remodelling of the nephron that results in expansion of distal convoluted tubule size but loss of overall tubule density; 3) renal damage and dysfunction when exposed to a Mars roundtrip dose-equivalent of simulated GCR.</p><p>The renewed zeitgeist for space travel, ushered in by the advent of commercial spaceflight and tourism, has spurred on state-funded agencies to embark on even more ambitious exploratory 'Deep Space' missions. The first of these, namely the Artemis Program, Lunar Gateway space station and later the Deep Space Transport/Mars Missions, will for the first-time place humans outside of Earth's protective magnetic field exposed to significant quantities of unmitigated space radiation and weightlessness for many months to years at a time.</p><p>The health effects of low Earth orbit (LEO) spaceflight (e.g. the International Space Station) are multiple, with much of the research communities' intense focus centred on the musculoskeletal, neurological, ocular and cardiovascular degeneration that can manifest as early as a few weeks into a mission. Notably, the effects of LEO spaceflight on many other organ systems are less clear, with indispensable organs such as the kidneys receiving relatively little attention in the absence of overt symptoms. However, in the face of extended periods of deep space travel health issues may only present with late onset due to cloaked subclinical pathophysiology and chronic damage eating into the extensive functional reserves of such organs.</p><p>The kidneys are critical in regulating blood pressure, by controlling both the renin/angiotensin/aldosterone system (RAAS) and the reabsorption of sodium chloride and water from the urine. In microgravity, the cephalad redistribution of blood volume with the concomitant decrease in the pressure gradient should reduce kidney perfusion. In turn, a lower perfusion pressure within the renal artery should lead to a greater release of renin and activation of the RAAS. However, studies show a marked reduction of diuresis and natriuresis in space with the RAAS, and antidiuretic hormone (ADH) increasing through unknown mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . These unexplained effects, be they mediated through known homeostatic mechanisms, or more theoretical ones, such as tensegrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> , are germane to kidney stone formation (i.e. nephrolithiasis). Astronauts have an unusually high rate of kidney stone formation, with 1-year post-flight astronauts experiencing incidence rates of 2-7 times that of pre-flight estimates, and in-flight risk estimated to be double that again <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . This is of mission critical significance, one Soviet in-flight renal stone episode nearly caused a mission termination due to the severe symptoms, but was relieved by spontaneous stone passage by the cosmonaut just before an urgent deorbit was initiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . It has been demonstrated that spaceflight associated changes in urinary biochemistry favour kidney stone formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> . Microgravity may have a direct effect on the crystallisation and nucleation of nascent kidney stones <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , but this is dwarfed by the net biochemical urinary changes historically attributed to the microgravity-induced bone demineralisation observed in spaceflight. A school of thought that has led to a paucity of research into other pathophysiological phenomena that may be contributing to the unusually high incidence of nephrolithiasis.</p><p>The kidney is a plastic organ, and is capable of dynamically remodelling the architecture of the nephron in response to changes in blood pressure or dietary potassium. An 18 day potassium-free diet resulted in a 31% increase in rat kidney weight, which was mainly seen in the medullary collecting duct <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . Changes in the size of nephron segments in wild type mice have been observed using advanced imaging techniques in a period as short as three days <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . So, it is plausible that spaceflight-induced shifts in fluid and electrolyte handling could precipitate maladaptive remodelling events that contribute to the underlying pathophysiology.</p><p>In addition to the well-studied environmental stressor of microgravity, deep space missions beyond the protection of the geomagnetosphere (the Van Allen belts) are exposed to space radiation. Space radiation comprises both intermittent events (e.g. Solar Particle Events or Solar Proton Events) with the most energetic being a Coronal Mass Ejection and Solar Wind and Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), with GCR having the most significant health impacts.</p><p>There is concern regarding the carcinogenic effect of GCR exposure in the planned Mars Missions. However, the kidney is an exquisitely radiation sensitive organ; it is the dose limiting organ in abdominal radiotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . Chronic kidney dysfunction can occur with acute low linear energy transfer (LET) Î³-radiation doses as low as &lt;0.5 Gy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> , the LET dose expected on a Mars Mission. However, GCR comprises low-LET x-and Î³-rays with protons and high energy 'HZE' ions of heavier elements (e.g. silicon, titanium, iron). It has been established that exposure to HZE ions results in mitochondrial damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . The renal proximal tubule is heavily dependent on mitochondrial respiration <ref type="bibr">17</ref> and is one of the main tubular segments in which damage is associated with kidney failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Indeed, proximal tubular injury is a prominent histological feature in medical (low-LET) radiation nephropathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . Due to their dependence on mitochondrial aerobic respiration, proximal tubular cells are extremely vulnerable to mitochondrial damage that we would expect from HZE exposure in addition to low-LET radiation damage.</p><p>We hypothesised that the biochemical urinary changes seen in spaceflight might reflect functional and morphological changes detectable in the kidney secondary to microgravity, possibly due to abnormal renal perfusion.</p><p>Further, we hypothesised that GCR exposure will cause mitochondrial and therefore proximal tubular dysfunction, leading to tissue damage and potentially irreversible loss of renal function, in addition to the known micro and macrovascular damage caused by GCR.</p><p>In order to explore these questions, we took a pan-omics approach incorporating anatomical and physiological parameters from 20 independent human and rodent spaceflight missions/simulations that had extant data and/or samples from which we could generate novel data (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Primary changes in kidney function increase the risk of spaceflight-induced nephrolithiasis</head><p>We analysed urinary and plasma parameters of interest for nephrolithiasis in 66 astronauts that stayed on the International Space Station (ISS) for up to 180 days. Values were analysed across time, including before, during and after flight. Our data showed an increased urinary excretion of metabolites and electrolytes that are considered risk factors for nephrolithiasis (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). In the figure, urinary excretion of calcium is expressed as fractional excretion (FE Ca ). In the absence of plasma calcium abnormalities FE Ca should be &lt; 1%; in astronauts, FE Ca increases significantly during flight. This urinary abnormality normalises on return to Earth (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). A less significant increase was seen in oxalate, phosphate, uric acid urinary excretion during spaceflight, all rapidly decreasing at return with some parameters transiently overcorrecting. Urinary citrate did not significantly change and remained within the normal range. There was also a decrease in urinary volume during spaceflight and an increase in urinary osmolality (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). Urinary electrolytes (chloride, sodium and potassium) remained stable during spaceflight compared to pre-flight with the exception of magnesium that, although within the normal range, significantly increased (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Calculated values including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), aldosterone:renin ratio, FE for urinary electrolytes and water, transtubular potassium gradient (TTKG) and the ratio of tubular maximum reabsorption of phosphate (TmP) to GFR can be found in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>. In addition, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref> shows plasma values from the SpaceX Inspira-tion4 mission. Although these astronauts only spent 3 days in space, there was a degree of eGFR instability detected several months after returning to Earth.</p><p>Although, most of the metabolite changes support the emergence of pro-lithogenic profile during spaceflight, they do not entirely explain the increased risk of nephrolithiasis in astronauts, suggesting that there might be other previously unidentified mechanisms underpinning this phenomenon.</p><p>To investigate this, we initially explored RR-10 spaceflight mouse kidney tissue epiproteomic data to infer functional changes. Posttranslational modifications of channels, transporters and pumps can alter their activity, and chief among these is phosphorylation status for which we noted several thousand significantly altered phosphosites (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>; Supplementary Data 1), suggesting a general increase in phosphatase and decrease in kinase activities (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3b</ref>). In particular, two of the most dramatically dephosphorylated proteins were the thiazide-sensitive Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC), encoded by SLC12A3, expressed in the distal convoluted tubule (and validated by phosphospecific antibody staining in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3c</ref>) and furosemide-sensitive Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2), encoded by SLC12A1, expressed in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>). These transporters requires phosphorylation of key residues at their N-terminus for activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> , and NKCC2 is regulated by the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and genetic (i.e., Bartter syndrome) or pharmacological (e.g., furosemide) impairment of NKCC2 leads to hypercalciuria, and is associated with nephrolithiasis. Whereas changes in NCC activity can lead to alterations in calcium handling and bone mineral density.</p><p>To look for corroborating evidence of primary changes in renal function, we analysed plasma and kidney tissue multi-omic data from human and mouse samples (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4a</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; Supplementary Data 2) for disease ontologies related to kidney stone formation. The nephrolithiasis and related ontologies were heavily represented across different datasets, providing orthogonal confirmation of real changes in the gene products comprising this ontology for spaceflight conditions vs controls. For example, Î±-tubulin (TUB1A1) is known to protect against cell-crystal adhesion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> but is decreased across multiple kidney datasets in our study (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>; Supplementary Data 3). In contrast, hypercalciuria and hyperoxaluria ontologies were scantily represented, implying that standard terrestrial causes of dysregulated urinary calcium and oxalate were not particularly enriched and therefore not strongly implicated in kidney stone formation.</p><p>The directional changes in nephrolithiasis-related faecal microbiome abundances between spaceflight and ground controls are illustrated in (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4b</ref>; Supplementary Data 4). Overall, these microbiota changes paint a mixed picture with some changes expected to confer a</p><p>Mission Experimental CondiÆŸon Species Sex Background GCR (mG) Mission DuraÆŸon (d) Sample

GO pathways (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6a</ref>; Supplementary Data 6) that are repeatedly significantly enriched across the datasets are compatible with remodelling events occurring in the kidney, these include regulation of cell adhesion, actin filament organisation, epithelial tube morphogenesis and renal system development pathways.</p><p>Enriched KEGG pathways (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6b</ref>; Supplementary Data 7 likewise include focal adhesion, tight junction, gap junction, sphingolipids, actin and cell cycle pathways, again consistent with remodelling.</p><p>Proteomic analysis of urine from the Russian Roscosmos human spaceflight mission (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6c</ref>) shows extracellular matrix (ECM) and lipid-turnover related proteins that were enriched 7 days after spaceflight compared to baseline. These include Fibronectin (FN1; involved in the organisation of the ECM), Cathepsin B (CTSB; maintains turnover of glomerular basement membrane <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> ), Apolipoprotein H (APOH; which binds to cell surface phospholipids) and Proactivator Polypeptide (PSAP; involved in the lysosomal degradation of sphingolipids). Notable among these are Nidogen-1 (NID1; a key part of the nephron basement membrane) and Podocalyxin (PODXL; a major constituent of the glycocalyx of podocytes in the glomerulus) which are two of the most frequently downregulated gene products across kidney datasets in our study (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>; Supplementary Data 3).</p><p>To determine the extent of any potential structural remodelling, we looked for macroscopic changes in GCR and/or microgravity exposed rodent kidneys. Much like Elger and co-workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> , who found an increase in kidney weight of 30% in chronically potassium depleted animals, we found that microgravity (simulated) and microgravity +GCR (real and simulated) exposed animals had significantly greater kidney weights (relative to bodyweight) than control animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7a</ref>).</p><p>To establish that these changes weren't merely due to alterations in extracellular fluid content, quantitative and qualitative histomorphometry was performed on mouse kidneys from the RR-10 spaceflight mission. Samples were stained for the canonical distal convoluted tubule marker Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC; encoded by SLC12A3), as this segment is known to be the most plastic in the nephron. Our data suggest that RR-10 mice have chronic dephosphorylation of NCC in addition to potentially altered basolateral potassium handling via Kir4.1/5.1 and KCC4, both of which are known to induce distal convoluted tubule remodelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3a</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>; Supplementary Data 1).</p><p>Qualitative assessment of 3D images of optically cleared tissues revealed no obvious lesions or anatomical abnormalities (See videos in Supplementary Movie 1 &amp; 2). However, quantitative analysis of distal convoluted tubules revealed that spaceflight led to a reduction in tubule density, but that these retained tubules had a larger average size, demonstrating tubular segment remodelling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Multi-omic analyses reveal convergent disease pathways induced by spaceflight</head><p>To understand the common processes occurring across the multiple human and rodent, spaceflight and GCR exposed missions, omics data were analysed against DisGeNET, KEGG and GO databases. Significantly enriched kidney-relevant disease ontologies that were reproduced in our diverse cohort of datasets were plotted in Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> for DisGeNET (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; Supplementary Data 2).</p><p>Many of the same ontologies are represented in both the spaceflight and simulated GCR experiments. Ontologies that are particularly enriched include amyloidosis, nephrotic syndrome, and membranous glomerulonephritis, reflecting the presence of acute phase and inflammatory gene products in addition to the profibrotic and cell death gene products represented in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5, renal fibrosis and renal insufficiency ontologies. The heavily enriched peripheral vascular disease and endothelial damage ontologies reflect the known endothelial and microvascular damage marker gene products enriched across the multiple GCR and spaceflight datasets.</p><p>Mitochondrial diseases are enriched in the proteomics datasets of kidney tissues (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>) and is further supported by the enrichment of ontologies relating to mitochondrial suborganellular structures, oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species, apoptosis, cellular senescence, HIF-1 and TNFÎ± signalling in GO (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>; Supplementary Data 6) and KEGG (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>; Supplementary Data 7) over-representation analyses. Mitochondria may also be showing signs of stress-induced fusion (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref>), although future studies would be needed to specifically address changes in mitochondria morphology.</p><p>As a final step we used the Scalable Precision Medicine Open Knowledge Engine (SPOKE) <ref type="bibr">29</ref> knowledge graph tool which is capable of integrating heterogeneous datasets from various biological levels, assay modalities, tissue types, organisms and experimental conditions to validate our findings (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">7</ref>).</p><p>A GCR exposure with a dose-equivalent to a Mars roundtrip induces renal damage and dysfunction LEO spaceflight mission participants are exposed to comparatively low doses of GCR due to the protection provided by Earth's magnetic field. Therefore, to disentangle the impacts of GCR from microgravity and evaluate the consequence of unmitigated GCR exposure, we examined tissues that had only been exposed to simulated GCR. To do this we utilised NASA's ground-based GCR simulator at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where animals either had an acute exposure to a ~1.5-year dose-equivalent (0.5 Gy) in the simplified 6-beam/5-ion GCR simulator followed by rapid 24 h sacrifice (BNL experiments) or were given an acute exposure to a ~2.5-year dose-equivalent (0.75 Gy) in the full 33beam/7-ion GCR simulator with sacrifice at 6 months post-exposure (NSRL-22A experiment).</p><p>Pathogenic serum miRNA species have been previously implicated to mediate tissue damage in spaceflight <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , and GCR is a plausible pathogenic factor. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) of plasma miRNAs revealed three clusters that generally trended downward in BNL-1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). However, investigation of miRNA predicted mRNA targets and DisGeNET analysis of these targets suggested that these circulating miRNAs would be minor players in the context of renal damage in the acute setting (Supplementary Data 8). Retaining biomolecular information within the gross and microanatomical context is important, especially when highly heterogenous tissues like the kidney (Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>). So, we next performed in situ hybridisation (RNAScope) and quantitative whole slide imaging to ascertain the presence and density of these pathogenic miRNAs in kidney tissues of BNL-3 mice. miR-125b was significantly increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla (ISOM) (Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>), particularly in the vascular compartment (arrows) which corresponds to the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, the thin descending limb of the loop and the medullary collecting duct. miR-16 has a similar pattern of distribution and differential expression but fails to reach significance (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). These miRNA species are implicated in vascular damage and the ISOM is also the site of the vascular bundle <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> , a complex structure which is the bottleneck of all blood flow to and from the inner medulla. Additionally, mRNA target prediction, KEGG and Dis-GeNET analysis of miR-125b and miR-16 suggest that these may mediate cell senescence, apoptosis, TGFÎ² signalling and oncogenesis (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>).</p><p>To further understand the effect of simulated GCR on the segment-specific cell types of the kidney's nephron (Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>), we performed 2D spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> ) on BNL-1 GCR-exposed renal tissue. Cell types were inferred using a published renal cell atlas <ref type="bibr">33</ref> , which were mapped onto individual data points which accurately reproduced anatomy (Fig. <ref type="figure">9c</ref>). Individual significant transcriptional changes in specific cell types were then examined and top hits were analysed by KEGG and DisGeNET (Fig. <ref type="figure">9d</ref>; Supplementary Data 10). Interestingly, immunoglobulin components were among the hits overexpressed by loop of Henle cells, presumably reflecting increased B-cell activity in the interstitium as supported by enrichment of the KEGG pathway for "leukocyte transendothelial migration" (Supplementary Data 10). SGK1 transcriptional activity was decreased in proximal convoluted and straight tubule cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">9d</ref>). SGK1 is a master regulator of multiple epithelial membrane transporters, including canonical segment specific transporters. The data also support disruption of circadian rhythm in several tubule segments via Cytochrome-1 and Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1 Group D Member 1 (also known as Rev-ErbÉ‘; encoded by NR1D1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">9d</ref>), and hits on KEGG and DisGeNET (Supplementary Data 10). When it comes to damage markers, again the proximal straight tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle appear to be the most impacted, with decrease in ALAS1, and increases in ANGPT2 and KRT18 all prognostically poor for renal outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">9d</ref>).</p><p>From a radiobiological perspective, the kidney is considered a late-responding tissue, and studies spanning at least 1-2 years may be required to appreciate the full impact of chronic GCR exposure on kidney health <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . Although, some features of radiation-induced nephropathy and sub-clinical manifestations can emerge in &lt; 6 months post-irradiation. To investigate this, serial tissue sections from NSRL-22A mice were histochemically stained for routine examination of potential kidney damage (haematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome stain, Martius Scarlet Blue) were examined by a blinded expert histopathologist (Fig. <ref type="figure">10a</ref>).</p><p>No histological evidence of differences in interstitial fibrosis or tissue calcifications were observed between Sham and GCR exposed tissues stained with PAS, Picrosirius Red and Von Kossa (Fig. <ref type="figure">10a</ref>). To confirm this, we quantitated the fractional interstitial area in the PAS stains which showed no difference between groups (mean 6.10% Â± 2.10 vs 6.16% Â± 2.27. p = 0.9623). As previously reported, first signs of fibrosis or calcifications may not present until after 6 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , and therefore NSRL-22A may be too short a period to observe these disease features, despite significant enrichment of fibrosis-related DisGeNET ontologies in the kidney proteomics from the same animals (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>; Supplementary Data 2). However, consistent with radiation-induced nephropathy, overt thrombotic microangiopathy was detected in GCR exposed tissues from 27% (3/11) female animals, and 0% (0/12) male animals. None was seen in tissue from sham exposed animals (Fig. <ref type="figure">10a</ref>).</p><p>Given the biomolecular and histopathological signs of renal injury, we then looked for functional evidence of glomerular, proximal tubular and distal tubular dysfunction. Urinary and plasma biochemical analyses (Fig. <ref type="figure">10b</ref>; Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>) showed significantly greater urinary protein excretion in GCR vs sham animals, consistent with a glomerular lesion or proximal tubule dysfunction, the latter supported by the reduction in the endocytic receptor megalin (LRP2) which normally reabsorbs proteins that escape into the ultrafiltrate (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). There was a slight increase in urinary glucose, which is a highly specific, but not very sensitive marker of proximal tubular dysfunction in non-diabetic animals. While this did not reach significance (p = 0.1198), there was significant downregulation of sodium-glucose linked transporter, SGLT1 (SLC5A1) (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), that would be consistent with proximal tubule dysfunction. Finally, there was significantly greater magnesiuria in GCR exposed animals, consistent with downregulated magnesium reabsorption in the loop of Henle or the distal convoluted tubule.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have presented a large volume of data encompassing both human and rodent data, extant and novel multi-omics datasets, historical and extant clinical chemistry and novel imaging data from 16 spaceflight missions and 4 GCR exposures to examine the effect of spaceflight on kidney function.</p><p>Tubular remodelling, by which we mean structural and functional adaptation of the tubular nephron to environmental stimuli, is a well described yet underappreciated phenomenon. Tubular remodelling occurs not only in response to genetic modification of signal pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> , but also chronic diuretic exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> , kidney injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , and both chronic <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and acute <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> hypokalaemia. These changes occur rapidly, within 3 days of diet induced hypokalaemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</p><p>Our data robustly and orthogonally supports tubular remodelling occurring in microgravity with and without GCR. This is highly likely to have functional consequences, as tubular remodelling does in other scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</p><p>Renal remodelling in microgravity (possibly related to the cephalad fluid shift) may therefore be a primary event that causes subsequent dysregulation of serum and urine electrolyte homeostasis. This is supported by the prompt return to baseline of humans on return to terrestrial gravity.</p><p>Changes in urinary biochemistry are known to be critical in the pathogenesis of kidney stone formation; a condition that occurs disproportionally commonly in astronauts, and that is potentially mission critical.</p><p>The increased risk for nephrolithiasis in space has been historically attributed to the negative impact of microgravity on bone mineral density that leads to increased resorption of bone, release of calcium salts in the bloodstream, increased renal load and therefore increased urinary excretion of calcium and phosphate <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Our historical data (from 66 astronauts) confirms hypercalciuria, and the phosphoproteomic data shows decreased phosphorylation of NKCC2 (SLC12A1), which will cause decreased paracellular reabsorption of divalent cations in the loop of Henle, and thus renal calcium and magnesium Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref> | Multi-mission multi-omic consensus on differentially regulated gene products in the kidney.

To integrate datasets from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules (e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites, isoforms, CpG sites).

Hypocitraturia was not observed; this is in line with previous observations by Pietryzk et al. of an approximate rate of 14% of hypocitraturia during spaceflight <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> , and Whitson et al. who found no significant hypocitraturia <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</p><p>Hyperoxaluria also occurs during spaceflight. Oxalate is freely filtered by the glomerulus and almost entirely excreted in the urine. Increased urinary oxalate reflects increased plasma oxalate load that could come from either increased endogenous liver production or increased absorption by the gut. The latter could be caused by several conditions such as increased dietary oxalate, malabsorptive conditions or altered microbiome. Dietary data were not available, and we assumed an absence of malabsorptive conditions. However, we do know that spaceflight affects the gut microbiome <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . Metagenomic analysis of the microbiome showed that in the highest quality faecal microbiome dataset (namely RR-23) Oxalobacter sp., the bacterium primarily responsible for oxalate metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> , increases during spaceflight. Bacteroides, a bacterium that was found to be increased in stone formers <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> , and Bifidobacterium, a pro-biotic able to metabolise oxalate in the gut <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> , were enriched and depleted in spaceflight respectively. It is difficult, based on low replicability of data to ascribe a primary, or even secondary microbiome-related aetiology for increased stone formation in spaceflight.</p><p>Proposed interventions to prevent potential mission critical kidney stone formation in spaceflight include increasing urine output by maximising oral fluid intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> , oral potassium citrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> (or potassium magnesium citrate <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> ) supplementation and inflight management, including ureteral stenting 50 and lithotripsy <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> . While these are sensible and may indeed be effective, none deal with the hypercalciuria that has been consistently shown in human space travellers. Oral or parenteral bisphosphonates have been used with some success <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . Further, thiazide diuretics reduce urinary calcium excretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> (possibly by ECV contraction causing increased proximal tubular calcium reabsorption <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> ) and reduce age related bone mineral density loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> , and could represent a "two birds with one stone" therapeutic option.</p><p>Could the dephosphorylation of NKCC2 guide us toward a therapeutic target to reduce spaceflight induced hypercalciuria? NKCC2 activity is modulated by the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) via phosphorylation <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> , and calcilytics (CaSR antagonists), well tolerated but disappointing agents in their utility for treating terrestrial osteoporosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> , might be one potential avenue to manipulate NKCC2 activity to ameliorate spaceflight induced hypercalciuria.</p><p>Abnormal water homeostasis has been noted in astronauts since the early days of spaceflight, with a marked reduction in both diuresis and natriuresis with vasopressin dysregulation via unknown mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . In fact, the reduced NKCC2 activity would conversely be anticipated to enhance diuresis, much like a loop diuretic. In this context, downregulation of prostaglandin transporters (PGT; encoded by SLCO2A1), a result seen in multiple of our proteomic and transcriptomic datasets (Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), is intriguing and may offer a way to reconcile this paradox. As carriers of a gain-of-function mutation of SLCO2A1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> , see a reduction in PGT activity in the proximal straight tubule and the cortical collecting duct which colocalises with Aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Loss of PGT-mediated reabsorption by collecting duct principal cells, causes a subsequent build-up in the luminal concentration of the prostaglandin PGE 2 , which stimulates apical prostaglandin E 2 receptor 4 (EP 4 ) receptors to activate Aquaporin-2 and inappropriate water reabsorption. In our study the loss of NKCC2 activity through dephosphorylation and reduction of PGT abundance can offset each other.</p><p>Tubular remodelling in spaceflight raises another, interesting question; is the hypercalciuria seen in spaceflight a consequence or cause of spaceflight related loss of bone mineral density (BMD)? We know that primary renal phenomena associated with tubular remodelling (e.g. genetic inactivation of SLC12A1 in Bartter syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> or chronic furosemide exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> ) can cause a loss of BMD as a consequence of the To integrate datasets from different omics modalities, species, missions and tissues, all biomolecules (e.g. phosphopeptides, proteins, transcripts and methylated DNA) were converted to the human orthologs where necessary and linked back to their HGNC gene symbol, aggregated and collapsed to single genes (e.g. multiple phosphosites, isoforms, CpG sites).

This implies that renally targeted therapies (e.g. thiazides, calcilytics) will be effective. There does appear to be a synergistic effect of microgravity and GCR on BMD loss; GCR does have primary bone effects, increasing osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> , so bone targeted countermeasures will still be relevant.</p><p>The kidney is a key microvascular end-organ and microvascular disease appears to be one of the main consequences of GCR exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . We concur with this view: vascular disease and endothelial dysfunction disease ontologies were highly enriched across omics datasets (Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>). Consistent with this, the arginine biosynthesis pathway was highly enriched across our human and mouse datasets (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4c</ref>), there was a significantly increased amount of pathogenic miR-125b in the highly vascular ISOM (Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>) and as a likely consequence of this microvascular pathology, we observed incidences of thrombotic microangiopathy on histopathological examination (Fig. <ref type="figure">10a</ref>).</p><p>In addition to this, pathophysiological macrovascular changes are a well-documented consequence of microgravity, with 6 months in space shown to induce ~20 years of vascular ageing through arterial stiffening <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> . The resultant loss of vascular elasticity, and thus buffering capacity, leads to elevated transmission of blood flow and pressure pulsatility to the microvasculature. Long-term, this can cause barotrauma or oxidative stress to renal microvasculature due to suboptimal perfusion, especially as the myogenic response of the afferent arteriole is to vasoconstrict and provide resistance (and thus reduce flow) in the face of excessive pulsatile pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> . Indeed arterial stiffness and CKD are strongly associated, and it is thought that one begets the other in a positive feedback loop <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> . Taken together with the general drop in blood pressure experienced by astronauts <ref type="bibr">64</ref> , exposure to spaceflight long-term places the kidney in an impossible position whereby it must choose whether to defend renal perfusion or the health of its microvasculature. If the arterioles dilate to enhance blood flow, they leave the microvasculature open to damage from Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref> | Biomolecular evidence for spaceflight-induced kidney damage.

Whereas if they constrict to provide protection to the microvasculature, they reduce blood flow and therefore oxygen supply to the renal tubules, which further compounds and exacerbates the chronic oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction from GCR bombardment.</p><p>This study is the largest to ever look at the effect of spaceflight on kidney function. We have demonstrated that there is renal structural and functional remodelling likely caused by microgravity, probably synergistically with GCR. We have shown that this remodelling is a potential driver of kidney stone formation and many of the changes in the urinary biochemistry of humans and animals experienced by those exposed to LEO spaceflight. We have also shown that acute exposure to simulated GCR causes both acute and chronic tubular epithelial and vascular damage that appears both progressive and irreversible.</p><p>However, our study has several limitations. We have necessarily relied on human (mostly male) and animal (mostly female) data from missions which were exposed to microgravity for relatively short periods of time compared to the projected length of a Mars mission, and only in LEO, which also limited the amount of GCR and other space radiation that they were exposed to. Additionally, our simulated GCR experiments only looked at acute unfractionated dosing, which may not accurately model the chronic cumulative exposure that would happen on a Mars mission.</p><p>Therefore, in the absence of experiments that can more accurately model the long-term simultaneous exposure to full GCR and microgravity over several years, and the plausible synergistic impact of these insults, our results should be taken a conservative glimpse into the potential dire health consequences of long-term deep space travel.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sex differences</head><p>For the human studies: NASA historical data is pooled and anonymised for ethical reasons.</p><p>Cosmonaut and JAXA data is all male. SpaceX data involves both sexes, but this cannot be disaggregated for ethical reasons of anonymity.</p><p>For the animal studies: The findings apply mostly female animals (roughly two thirds of animal missions were female). As we were collecting data from previously conducted experiments, we did not have the ability to alter this sex disparity. Only one study had both males and females, which enabled us to perform sex difference analyses for parameters such as blood and urine electrolytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample sizes</head><p>Due to the nature of our study we used samples from animals that had been in spaceflight (usually as part of the 'Rodent Research' missions to the International Space Station) or had been taken from costly experiments using the Galactic Cosmic Radiation Simulator at Brookhaven national laboratories. We also used samples and/or data from humans who had undergone spaceflight (in historical NASA missions, Roscosmos missions, and JAXA missions to the ISS or modern commercial missions with SpaceX such as inspiration4). Our sample numbers were therefore limited to the number of samples made available to us in the original experimental designs or mission parameter limitations (restricted by practical considerations of weight to launch, available space and resource consumption). In all cases, we endeavoured to use the maximum number of biological replicates available to us to maximise experimental power.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics and reproducibility</head><p>Omics studies. This study encompassed 2 epigenomic (Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing), 9 transcriptomic (8 Bulk RNA sequencing, 1 Bulk small RNA sequencing), 7 proteomic (3 Quantitative fractionated TMT-labelled DDA LC-MS/MS, 2 Quantitative label-free SEER DIA LC-MS/MS, 1 Plasma Slow Off-Rate Modified Aptamers, 1 Shotgun LC-MS/ MS), 1 epiproteomic (Quantitative fractionated TMT-labelled DDA LC-MS/MS of phospho-enriched peptides), 3 metabolomic (Quantitative label-free UHPLC-MS/MS) and 6 metagenomic (4 Whole metagenome shotgun sequencing, 2 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) studies on both humans and animals.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Physiology Sample collection and processing. NSRL-22A</head><p>Urine collection was performed in awake mice to obtain spontaneous and uncontaminated samples. Mice were gently handled over a sheet of SaranÂ® wrap or ParafilmÂ® to facilitate micturition. Upon collection, each urine sample was carefully divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was immediately acidified with HNO3 to achieve a final concentration of 1% v/v, preventing precipitation of electrolytes and maintaining sample integrity. Both aliquots were then promptly stored at -80 Â°C to preserve their biochemical constituents until further analysis. For blood collection, mice were subjected to terminal anaesthesia to minimise distress and ensure compliance with ethical guidelines. Blood samples were drawn from the vena cava using a fine needle and syringe. Plasma was separated by transferring the blood into MicrovetteÂ® CB 300 LH (Sarstedt) tubes and centrifuging at 2000 g for 5 min. The resulting plasma supernatant was carefully aspirated and stored at -80 Â°C for future analysis. Both plasma and non-acidified urine samples were analysed for creatinine levels by employing either the standard Jaffe reaction or the enzymatic method, depending on the investigator's preference and laboratory resources. Electrolyte levels, biochemistries and biomarkers were assessed using the Siemens Dimension RxL Max Integrated Chemistry System, at the Core Biochemical Assay Laboratory at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Imaging</head><p>Sample fixation and processing. Mouse kidney samples were harvested and fixed through immersion in freshly prepared 4% (w/v) formaldehyde-PBS solution (pH 6.9) for 16 h at 37 Â°C. Subsequently, the samples were washed three times with PBS with 0.02% Na-Azide and stored at 4 Â°C until they were embedded in paraffin.</p><p>Histopathology and Brightfield WSI. 2-3Âµm FFPE sections from NSRL-22A kidneys were prepared, deparaffinised using Histoclear (National Diagnostics), and rehydrated through a series of graded methanol steps. These were then stained for either Haematoxylin and Eosin (#ab245880, Abcam) or Masson's Trichrome (#ab150686, Abcam) according to the manufacturers guidelines.</p><p>Sections underwent brightfield whole slide imaging with 20X objective tiled and stitched focus stacks taken for each section on a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner. The resultant images were viewed in QuPath (v0.4.3) and semi-quantitatively scored for any histopathological findings.</p><p>Immunostaining and confocal WSI. 5 Âµm FFPE sections from RR-10 kidneys were prepared, deparaffinised using Histoclear (National Diagnostics), and rehydrated through a series of graded methanol steps. Antigen retrieval was performed using [1X] R-Universal buffer (AP0530) in a 2100 antigen retriever for a single heat-pressure cycle (Aptum Biologics). Sections were then permeabilized with 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100-PBS solution for 20 minutes and incubated with Section Block 'ready-to-use' (AP0471; Aptum Biologics) for 30 mins at RT. Primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 Â°C for 16 hours at specified concentrations (see supplementary methods), diluted in Antibody Diluent 'FF/PE Sections' (AP0472; Aptum Biologics). For phospho-specific antibodies, 10 Î¼g/ml of the non-phospho peptide used to raise the antibody was added per 2 Î¼g/ml of the antibody used. Negative control samples omitted the primary antibody and were processed simultaneously. Following incubation, slides were washed by dipping slides 50x times in 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100-PBS for 3 rounds, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 hour at RT. Preabsorbed fluorochrome conjugated secondary antibodies were utilised at specified concentrations (concentrations (see supplementary methods), diluted in Antibody Diluent 'FF/PE Sections' (AP0472; Aptum Biologics). After washing, slides were mounted using Prolong Gold antifade (#P36930, Life Technologies), permitted to cure for 48-72hrs, sealed with CoverGrip Coverslip Sealant (#23005; Biotium) and protected from light exposure.</p><p>Immunofluorescent images were captured using either a Zeiss LSM700 LED laser-scanning confocal microscope or Leica SP8 whitelight laser-scanning confocal microscope using 488-nm, 555-nm and 639-nm laser lines, employing a 10X/0.3NA (Zeiss) or 10X/0.5NA (Leica) objective. Zeiss acquisition parameters included single field of view, 8-bit resolution, 1844 x 1844 pixels, 1x digital zoom, 3.85Âµs pixel dwell time, 4-line Kalman filtering, sequential (by line) channel imaging, and a 4-slice z-stack with a 6 Âµm thickness to account for chromatic aberration.</p><p>Leica acquisition parameters included tile scanning with a 10% overlap, 8-bit resolution, 1024 Ã— 1024 pixels, 0.75x digital zoom, 600 Hz scan speed, 6-line Kalman filtering, sequential (by line) channel imaging, and a 3-slice z-stack with a 5 Âµm thickness to account for chromatic aberration.</p><p>Images were processed using FIJI image analysis software (v.1.53p). Fluorescent z-stacks underwent background subtraction (200 px radius rolling ball) and maximum intensity z-projection. Brightness and contrast adjustments were made using linear histogram stretching to enhance visibility. miRNA in situ hybridisation and brightfield WSI. FFPE blocks for BNL-3 kidneys were trimmed to remove tissue exposed to air, and fresh 5 Âµm sections were taken. These were not baked onto the slide and stored with desiccant instead. Samples were then processed using the miRNAscopeâ„¢ HD RED assay (#324531 and #324500, ACD-Biotechne) with the FFPE tissue section workflow according to the manufacturers guidelines. miRNAscopeâ„¢ Probes against the following were used: mmu-miR-125b-5p (#1082311-S1), mmu-let-7a-5p (#727761-S1) and mmu-miR-16-5p (729031-S1).</p><p>Sections underwent brightfield whole slide imaging with 20X objective tiled and stitched focus stacks (with extended depth of focus) taken for each section on a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 slide scanner. Using QuPath (v0.4.3) the cortex, outer stripe of the outer medulla, inner stripe of the outer medulla and inner medulla were manually annotated with the aid of a Wacom cintiq pro 32 to create a segmentation mask of the anatomical regions for area calculation. Ilastik (v1.4.0) 65 automated (supervised) pixel-level classification was then trained to identify positive miRNAscope probe staining. A custom inhouse python script was then used to count all positive staining and calculate the area of all anatomical regions, so that the density of each miRNA per unit area of each region could be determined for each kidney section.</p></div>

Tissue transformation, delipidation and refractive index matching</head><p>Quartered formaldehyde-fixed kidneys from RR-10 mice were tissue transformed using the SHIELD protocol <ref type="bibr">66</ref> and reagents from Lifecanvas technologies (MA, USA) based on (10.1038/nbt.4281). SHIELD-transformed kidneys were delipidated (Lifecanvas Technologies; Full Passive Pipeline Protocol v4.06) for approximately 10-14 days at 37 Â°C in 40 mL of passive delipidation buffer with gentle agitation in EasyClear device. Following delipidation, tissues were washed in several rounds of PBS at 37ËšC overnight to remove any delipidation buffer. Before imaging tissues were immersed in Incubated in EasyIndex RI 1.53 refractive index matching solution as per protocol. Tissues were then embedded in 2% w/v ultra-low melting point agarose (Sigma A5030) blocks made up with EasyIndex solution to immobilise the samples. These were then stored in EasyIndex in airtight containers shielded from light prior to imaging.</p><p>MesoSPIM imaging Samples were mounted in quartz cuvettes and immersion oil with refractive indices matching that of EasyIndex, and then suspended and aligned for light-sheet fluorescence imaging with a MesoSPIM 67 . Images were captured at 16-bit for 1-channel dual laser lightsheet illumination (488 nm excitations) to obtain autofluorescence emissions at 2048 x 2048 pixels in the XY, with a Z depth range of 700-1200 pixels, giving a pixel resolution of 3.26 Î¼m (XY) and 4.0 Î¼m (Z).</p><p>Image analysis To evaluate any qualitative changes in gross morphology images were imported into Syglass 68 (v.1.7.2-79; <ref type="url" target="https://www.syglass.io/">https://www.syglass.io/</ref>; RRID: SCR_017961) for visual investigation by nephrologists and histopathologists in 3D virtual space using Meta Quest 2 VR headsets.

PI and NASA GeneLab records for all animals included in the study were examined for bodyweight and kidney wet weight measurements. Only BNL-1, BNL-2, BNL-3 and RR-23 missions had complete kidney and body weight information available. Where available, the weights of both left and right kidneys were averaged, and the kidney weights were normalised against bodyweight for the same animal and expressed as a percentage. All ground control and sham animals that received no exposure treatment were grouped into control for pairwise comparisons against GCR (animals that only received either full or simplified galactic cosmic radiation simulations) or MG (animals that only underwent hindlimb unloading microgravity simulation) or GCR + MG (animals that underwent a combination of GCR and MG or were exposed to spaceflight).</p><p>Histomorphometry. Whole slide images of tiled immunofluorescent confocal images taken from RR-10 were used for analysis. Using QuPath (v0.4.3) the cortex was manually annotated with the aid of a Wacom cintiq pro 32 to create a segmentation mask of the anatomical region for area calculation. Similarly distal convoluted tubules (DCT) labelled with antibodies against total NCC / phospho-NCC (see supplementary methods for details), the canonical DCT marker, were annotated. Initially, only a handful of tubules were annotated from each slide, and these were then used to train Ilastik (v1.4.0) <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> for automated (supervised) pixel-level classification of DCTs. These were then further manually refined to remove/include any false-positive/ negatives. A custom in-house python script was then used to compute the number of discrete tubules positive for DCT markers, the corresponding area of each of these as well as the total cortex area, such that average tubule area and DCT density per area of cortex could be determined for each kidney section.</p></div>
