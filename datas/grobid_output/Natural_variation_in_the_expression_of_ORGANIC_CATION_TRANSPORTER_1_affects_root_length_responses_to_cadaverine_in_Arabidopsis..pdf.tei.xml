<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Polyamines, including cadaverine, are organic cations that affect numerous biological processes including transcription, translation, cell signalling, and ion channel activity. They often function in biotic and abiotic stress responses in plants. Because little is known about how plants respond to cadaverine, a quantitative natural variation approach was used to identify genetic factors that contribute to this response. Here it is shown that Arabidopsis thaliana accessions have varying root length responses to exogenous cadaverine: Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) was one of the most resistant accessions tested, whereas Landsberg erecta (Ler) was one of the most sensitive. Recombinant inbred lines, near isogenic lines, and a microarray were used to show that variation in ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1) is at least partially responsible for this difference. OCT1 expression was higher in Cvi than in Ler, and oct1 mutants were more sensitive to cadaverine than wild-type plants. In oct1 mutants transformed with an ectopic copy of OCT1 originating from either Cvi or Ler, the expression level of the transgene, not its accession, correlated with the cadaverine response. These results suggest that decreased OCT1 expression confers cadaverine sensitivity in some accessions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Polyamines are organic cations that are prevalent in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Putrescine, spermidine, and spermine are the most common polyamines in plants, although thermospermine and cadaverine have also been found in many species including Arabidopsis thaliana <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Shevyakova et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Knott et al., 2007)</ref>. Polyamines exist both as free molecules and as conjugates to other small molecules, mainly hydroxycinnamic acids, or proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bagni and Tassoni, 2001)</ref>. Both free and conjugated polyamines are important for cellular processes including cell growth, cell division, transcription, translation, and cell death. Their positive charges allow for interactions with nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, which affect the activities and stabilities of these molecules (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Hussain et al., 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Polyamines accumulate in certain plant tissues under many abiotic stresses including drought, salt, osmotic, and temperature stress, which all result in metabolic reprogramming and modifications to growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Cuevas et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alet et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Wang et al., 2011)</ref>. Polyamines may protect against these stresses in several ways, including by altering gene expression, increasing the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and altering the cellular accumulation of ions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Liu et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Takahashi et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tang and Newton, 2005)</ref>. They may also function as signals that regulate cross-talk between hormonal pathways during stress responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Obata and Fernie, 2012)</ref>. Though essential for proper development, and beneficial at higher levels during stress, catabolism of polyamines produces H 2 O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Tisi et al., 2011)</ref>. Although it is toxic, H 2 O 2 also diffuses to nearby tissues where it activates various responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Neill, 2002)</ref>. To balance these effects, polyamine synthesis, degradation, localization, and conjugation must be tightly controlled.</p><p>Five potential Arabidopsis POLYAMINE UPTAKE TRANSPORTER (PUT) proteins were identified based on sequence similarity to known polyamine transporters in Leishmania major and Trympanosoma cruzi <ref type="bibr">(Mulangi et al., 2012a, b)</ref>. When expressed in the polyamine uptake-deficient Î”agp2 Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Aouida et al., 2005)</ref>, these proteins partially restored sensitivity to the polyamine analogue paraquat as well as to putrescine and spermidine. They also partially restored putrescine and spermidine uptake into the cells <ref type="bibr">(Mulangi et al., 2012a)</ref>. PAR1/PUT2 has subsequently been shown to localize to the Golgi where it is required for the subcellular localization of paraquat in the chloroplast <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Li et al., 2013)</ref>. RMV1/PUT3 has been shown to be plasma membrane associated and to function in paraquat, putrescine, spermidine, and spermine uptake in Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fujita et al., 2012)</ref>. However, cadaverine transport by these proteins was not tested.</p><p>Less is known about cadaverine compared with the other polyamines. It is synthesized from lysine and therefore not directly derived from the polyamine putrescine, unlike spermidine, spermine, and thermospermine. Cadaverine is produced by some soil bacteria and yeast, possibly contributing to rhizosphere-root signalling <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Perrig et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Cloete et al., 2009)</ref>. Exogenous cadaverine affects root development in several ways: it increases adventitious root growth in pine trees, lateral root formation in soybeans, and root weight in rice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Niemi et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">CassÃ¡n et al., 2009)</ref>, whereas it shortens primary roots in soybeans <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gamarnik and Frydman, 1991)</ref>.</p><p>Cadaverine levels and localization change upon exposure to stress. This molecule accumulates dramatically upon oxidative stress in rape leaves and upon drought stress in peppers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aziz et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Sziderics et al., 2010)</ref>. In the ice plant, salt stress causes cadaverine to accumulate in true leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kuznetsov et al., 2007)</ref>, and heat shock stimulates cadaverine transport away from the heated tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Shevyakova et al., 2001)</ref>. Cadaverine also confers protection against stress. It induces stomatal closure, a common stress response, in fava beans <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Liu et al., 2000)</ref>, and it prevents decreases in root and shoot weight upon oxidative stress in rice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(CassÃ¡n et al., 2009)</ref>.</p><p>Despite its profound impacts on overall cellular homeostasis and plant growth under stressful conditions, the underlying mechanisms that explain how cadaverine alters plant growth and development are still unknown. To address this gap, natural variation in root length sensitivity to exogenous cadaverine was examined, and ORGANIC CATION TRANSPORTER 1 (OCT1, AT1G73220) was identified as an important quantitative trait locus (QTL) involved in this response.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head><p>Plant materials QTL analysis used the following stocks from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (Columbus, OH, USA): Cape Verde Islands (Cvi; CS8580), Landsberg erecta-2 Ler-2; CS8581), and a population of Cvi/Ler recombinant inbred lines (RILs; CS22000). This population consists of 162 individual RILs that were genotyped at 293 marker loci <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alonso-Blanco et al., 1998)</ref>. The near isogenic lines (NILs) <ref type="bibr">LCN1-12, -15, -14, -21, -22, and -28 (N717058, N17060, N17061, N17067, N17068, and N17074)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Keurentjes et al., 2007)</ref> were obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Center (Nottingham, UK). An-1 (CS22626), Bs-1 (CS6627), Knox-18 (CS22567), Sq-8 (CS22601), Ull2-3 (CS22587), and Wei-0 (CS22622) seed came from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The oct1-1 mutant and oct1-1 [35S pro :OCT1 WS ] transgenic lines were provided by Christine <ref type="bibr">Lelandais-Briere (Lelandais-BriÃ¨re et al., 2007)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Growth conditions</head><p>The seeds were sterilized by washing them with 95% ethanol. Except where noted in the text, they were plated on half-strength buffered Linsmaier and Skoog medium containing micro-and macronutrients, vitamins, and 1.5% sucrose (Caisson Laboratories, North Logan, UT, USA) that was supplemented with 1.5% agar type E (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and polyamines (Sigma-Aldrich) as required. The seedlings were stratified for 2-8 d and grown in either a Conviron TC16 growth chamber or an Enconair (now BioChambers, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) Controller 6000 growth chamber for each experiment. Both chambers were set at 22 Â°C and a 16 h light/8 h dark cycle, and the light intensity was 50-70 Î¼mol m -2 s -1 and provided by cool-white fluorescent bulbs (Grainger, Lake Forest, IL, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Root length measurements</head><p>Seedling images were taken from the backs of the plates using a scanner (Epson, Suwa, Nagano Prefecture, Japan). Root length was measured using the segmented line tool in NIH Image (publically available at <ref type="url" target="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/</ref>) or the Neuron J plugin <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Meijering et al., 2004)</ref> for Image J <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Schneider et al., 2012)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microscopy</head><p>To calculate cell length, the cell walls were stained by transferring the seedlings to 10 Î¼g ml -1 propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) for ~20 min. Imaging was conducted using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal microscope (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA), and cell length measurements were performed in Adobe Photoshop.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>QTL mapping</head><p>Plants were grown at a 30 Â° tilt for 6 d on media with or without cadaverine. A concentration of 50 Î¼M cadaverine was used in trial 1, and 100 Î¼M cadaverine was used in trial 2. The mean root length value on medium containing cadaverine was subtracted from the mean value on control medium and then divided by the mean on control medium. This number was subtracted from 1, and this ratio, along with genotypic data for each RIL <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alonso-Blanco et al., 1998)</ref>, was entered into WinQTL Cartographer version 2.5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Wang et al., 2010)</ref> and the r/qtl package in R (<ref type="url" target="http://www.r-project.org">http://www.r-project.org</ref>). For WinQTL Cartographer, maps were created using the Kosambi map function. During composite interval mapping, the model incorporated a 0.5 step rate with a 1.0 cM window size and 10 control markers. LOD thresholds were determined by 1000 permutations. In r/qtl, the function 'scanone' was used for interval mapping, and 'scantwo' was used to generate the two-dimensional plot. Significance levels were determined by 1000 permutations, implementing the EM algorithm. Fine mapping of the NILs was performed using standard methods and the primers listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> available at JXB online.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RT-PCR and qRT-PCR</head><p>Approximately 24 seedlings were grown at a 30 Â° backward tilt at staggered times for each biological replicate on medium containing no cadaverine unless otherwise indicated. Whole roots from 7-dayold seedlings were dissected and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was prepared using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, The Netherlands) and stored at -80 ÂºC until use, typically within a few days. RNA samples were treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the instructions. The ratios at absorbencies of 260 to 280 and at 260 to 230 as well as gel electrophoresis were used to verify RNA quality. Poor quality samples were not used for subsequent experiments. RNA concentrations were determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</p><p>For reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), cDNA was made using the iScriptâ„¢ cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR were done simultaneously using a qScriptâ„¢ One-Step qRT-PCR Kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The samples were run on a LightCycler Â® 480 Real Time-PCR System (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). Each 6 Î¼l reaction contained RNA at a final concentration of 2 ng Î¼l -1 and each primer at a concentration of 0.65 Î¼M. Other components were included at the concentrations defined by the kit. Control reactions without reverse transcriptase were included and did not yield any detectable expression. Cycling conditions were 49 ÂºC for 10 min, 95 ÂºC for 5 min, and 45 cycles of 95 ÂºC for 5 s, 55 ÂºC for 15 s, and 72 ÂºC for 10 s. Melt curves were used to verify specificity. Four technical replicates were performed for each sample for each biological replicate, and three biological replicates were performed. LinRegPCR was used to analyse the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Ramakers et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>The primers used to amplify OCT1 were: 1F (5â€² GTGGCTGTT CCTTCCACACT 3â€²), 1R (5â€² AAAGGCCGTGACGAAAGTTA 3â€²), 2F (5â€² CATCCTCGACAGCGTATGAC 3â€²), 2R (5â€² CCTTC CTAACGCAACTAGCA 3â€²), 3F (5â€² TTTGGTGTTGCATCAGTG CT 3â€²), and 3R (5â€² CGGAGCGTTTCGAGTTTCT 3â€²). 4R (5â€² CGTGAAATGCGTGTTGAAAG 3â€²) was used to detect possible transcript that extended into the T-DNA region. Primers 3F and 3R as well as 5â€² CCTCTTGGATACGCGGTTT 3â€² and 5â€² CAAGA AGCCATCGAGGAGAC 3â€² were used for OCT1 qRT-PCR. Primers used to amplify the reference gene At1g58050 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Czechowski et al., 2005)</ref> were: 5â€² CCATTCTACTTTTTGGCGGCT 3â€² and 5â€² TCAATGGTAACTGATCCACTCTGATG 3â€². This reference gene was chosen due to its consistent expression and its similar expression level to OCT1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Czechowski et al., 2005)</ref> Transgenic constructs Genomic DNA from Cvi and Ler was used to amplify the region extending from 2079 bases before the start codon through to 417 bases after the stop codon of OCT1. This region was cloned in between the attL1 and attL2 sites in the Gateway entry vector pENTR/D-TOPO (Life Technologies, Madison, WI, USA). An LR reaction was performed to transfer this region into the binary vector pMDC99 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Curtis and Grossniklaus, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Xu and Li, 2008)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Arabidopsis accessions vary in their root length responses to cadaverine</head><p>As a first step toward identifying genes involved in root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine, seedlings of eight Arabidopsis accessions were grown on media containing 0, 100, and 500 Î¼M cadaverine. A decrease in root length between control and increasing cadaverine treatments was observed for all accessions tested (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Alterations in root waving and skewing and an increase in adventitious and lateral root emergence were also noticed in most accessions (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref> at JXB online). In terms of root length, Cvi-1 and Knox-18 were some of the most resistant accessions to cadaverine, whereas Ler-2 was one of the most sensitive (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>).</p><p>To determine whether the effect of cadaverine on root length was due to reduced cell elongation or division, the length of the epidermal cells in the mature root zone of Ler seedlings grown on media containing 0 Î¼M or 100 Î¼M cadaverine was measured. It was found that although Ler roots were only ~35% as long on this concentration of cadaverine as on control medium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), the average cell length of the seedlings on the medium containing cadaverine was ~64% of that of seedlings on control medium (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). This suggests that the reduction in root length is probably due to a combination of reduced cell elongation and division. A QTL on chromosome 1 affects root length responses to cadaverine</p><p>Due to the large difference between Cvi and Ler in root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine, a QTL study was performed with a group of RILs created from the two accessions. Other pairs of accessions would have been equally interesting to use for QTL analysis but, at the time this experiment was initiated, the CviÃ—Ler population was the available population created from accessions with the most differing cadaverine responses. These RILs were previously characterized for genotypic contribution from the two parental lines along the five chromosomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Alonso-Blanco et al., 1998)</ref>. For both the parental lines and the RILs, root growth on medium containing cadaverine compared with growth on control plates lacking this compound was quantified. RIL mean root length ratios showed transgression with respect to the parental means (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Furthermore, growth on 0 Î¼M and 50 Î¼M cadaverine displayed broad sense heritability values of 0.46 and 0.56, respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that this population is well suited for QTL mapping of root growth responses to exogenous cadaverine. Using both composite interval mapping and a 2D scan approach, a strong QTL for relative root growth response to cadaverine was identified at the end of chromosome 1 in two independent trials (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). The additive portion of the QTL graph (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>, bottom) predicts that having a Ler allele at this location results in a shorter root upon cadaverine treatment compared with a Cvi allele. No epistasis was observed between this QTL and other parts of the genome (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Near isogenic lines confirm the chromosome 1 QTL</head><p>Six NILs with Cvi introgression of varying segments of chromosome 1 within an otherwise Ler background <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Keurentjes et al., 2007)</ref> were used to confirm the root length QTL. The four LCN1 lines that contain a Cvi introgression at the end of chromosome 1 showed greater, more Cvi-like resistance to cadaverine than LCN1-12 and LCN1-22, the NILs that do not contain a Cvi introgression in this region (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). The Ler to Cvi breakpoints in these lines were fine-mapped, and the candidate region was narrowed to a 5.3 Mb interval at the end of chromosome 1 (primers shown in Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> at JXB online).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Identification of candidate genes for the chromosome 1 QTL</head><p>Because many of the causative loci behind the QTL are due to differences in gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alonso-Blanco et al., 2009)</ref>, gene expression differences between Cvi and Ler were examined in the candidate region using previously published microarray data <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Vaughn and Masson, 2011)</ref>. The primary data are publicly available at Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI; accession number GSE28275). From these arrays, 19 probe sets representing genes located in the candidate chromosomal segment give hybridization signals that differ significantly (95% confidence interval) by â‰¥2-fold between Cvi and Ler (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). The largest predicted differentially expressed gene in this region was OCT1, which was estimated to show a 73-fold increase in Cvi compared with Ler.</p><p>No other genes in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> encode proteins that are directly relevant to polyamine metabolism or transport. Genes encoding a transglutaminase (At1g69820) and a cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (At1g72680), both possibly linked to the formation of polyamine conjugates <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Serafini-Fracassini and Del Duca, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Fellenberg et al., 2009)</ref>, are found in this QTL interval; however, they do not show â‰¥2-fold expression differences between Cvi and Ler.</p><p>OCT1 from Cvi and Ler genomic DNA was sequenced. No large insertions or deletions were found, and only one amino acid change was found: residue 431 in the second exon is serine in Cvi and alanine in Ler (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> at JXB online). Analysing the 2 kb of sequence upstream of the start codon revealed numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms and small insertions but no large insertions or deletions (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). Based on these data, it was hypothesized that OCT1 expression differences contribute to root length responses to exogenous cadaverine. qRT-PCR data confirmed the microarray result and showed that OCT1 expression was ~14 times as high in Cvi roots as in Ler roots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Cadaverine treatment did not significantly change OCT1 expression in either accession (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>oct1-1 mutants express a truncated OCT1 transcript</head><p>To evaluate a role for OCT1 in root length responses to cadaverine, the oct1-1 mutant, which was previously found to carry a single T-DNA insertion near the 3' end of the gene, was obtained; both ends of the insertion were characterized <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lelandais-BriÃ¨re et al., 2007)</ref>. This mutant was also reported to not express any OCT1 RNA, as determined by RT-PCR using primers aligning on each side of the intron <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lelandais-BriÃ¨re et al., 2007)</ref>. To confirm this result, RT-PCR was performed on oct1-1 and (Wassilewskija) WS wildtype root RNA samples. As expected, PCR products were obtained from WS wild-type cDNA samples of the expected sizes using multiple primer sets (1F/1R, 2F/2R, and 3F/3R) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> at JXB online). Also, no transcript was observed for oct1-1 mutants using primer sets near the 3â€² end of the gene (2F/2R, 3F/3R, and 2F/4R) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>).</p><p>However, it was found that oct1-1 plants do express a partial OCT1 transcript using primers on each side of the intron (1F/1R) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref> at JXB online). This product size corresponds to approximately the predicted length if the intron is not spliced out of the RNA (238 bases instead of 135 bases), which would result in a premature stop codon in the intron. No product for any primer set was detected in control reactions without reverse transcriptase, which confirms the lack of genomic DNA contamination (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). Therefore, oct1-1 produces a truncated OCT1 transcript that is highly unlikely to encode a functional protein.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>oct1-1 shows increased cadaverine sensitivity</head><p>If Ler roots have higher sensitivity to cadaverine compared with Cvi roots because they have lower OCT1 expression, then oct1 mutant roots should also respond more strongly to cadaverine than wild-type plants. To test this, WS wild type, oct1-1, and two independent transgenic rescue lines (oct1-1 [35S pro :OCT1 WS ]) were grown on control medium and medium supplemented with cadaverine. Rescue line 1 had significantly higher OCT1 expression compared with the WS wild type, whereas rescue line 2 had a similar level of OCT1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). It was found that all of these plants had the same root length on control medium lacking cadaverine, but oct1-1 mutant roots were significantly shorter than wild-type roots on media containing 50 Î¼M and 500 Î¼M cadaverine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>). Robust root growth on medium containing cadaverine was restored in both independent transgenic rescue lines. Rescue line 2 showed a wildtype-like response to cadaverine, and rescue line 1 showed increased resistance to cadaverine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>). These results suggest that reduced OCT1 expression confers increased cadaverine sensitivity.</p><p>The WS wild type and oct1-1 had similar root lengths on media containing the polyamines putrescine, spermidine, and  <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Jander et al., 2002)</ref>. spermine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>), which shows that this sensitivity is specific to cadaverine. Polyamines have been shown to shorten root growth through the generation of H 2 O 2 by diamine and polyamine oxidases, which promotes premature cell differentiation and programmed cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Tisi et al., 2011)</ref>. However, because the cadaverine-hypersensitive response of oct1-1 was specific to cadaverine (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>), OCT1 probably functions in a different aspect of polyamine-mediated root growth regulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The expression level of OCT1, not its accession origin, correlates with cadaverine sensitivity</head><p>To determine if differences in the OCT1 sequence between Cvi and Ler or only OCT1 expression levels correlated with the cadaverine response, OCT1 was cloned from Cvi and Ler, and these constructs were introduced into oct1-1 mutants. These transgenic lines were then tested on media containing 0 Î¼M and 50 Î¼M cadaverine, and their relative root lengths were measured. A range of cadaverine resistance levels that did not correlate with the accession source of the transgene was found (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A</ref>).</p><p>Because the insertion location can affect transgene expression, it was predicted that the OCT1 expression levels would correlate with cadaverine sensitivity. To test this, OCT1 expression was measured in four of these lines by qRT-PCR. As expected, a range of OCT1 expression levels was found in the transgenic lines regardless of whether the OCT1 untranslated and coding regions came from Cvi or Ler. In general, lines with increased resistance to cadaverine had higher OCT1 expression (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genes other than OCT1 probably also contribute to the cadaverine response</head><p>The data suggest that differences in OCT1 expression contribute significantly to the different cadaverine root length responses in Cvi and Ler. To determine if differences in OCT1 expression among other natural accessions also correlate with  variability in cadaverine sensitivity, OCT1 expression was measured in two other accessions, one resistant to cadaverine (Knox-18) and one sensitive to cadaverine (Sq-8). It was found that both lines had higher OCT1 expression than Ler even though only Knox-18 was more resistant to cadaverine than Ler. Furthermore, Sq-8 displayed higher OCT1 expression than Knox-18 despite being more sensitive to cadaverine (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref> at JXB online). The OCT1 sequences of the eight natural accessions initially selected for the analysis of cadaverine response were also compared. Polymorphisms shared among the three most resistant accessions (Cvi-1, Knox-18, and Ull2-3) or the three most sensitive accessions (An-1, Ler-2, and Sq-8) were not seen (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). Together, these data suggest that factors other than OCT1 expression may also contribute significantly to differential cadaverine sensitivity among these accessions. Ectopic copies of OCT1 derived from Cvi or Ler were also introduced into Columbia and Ler wild-type plants. Ler root length is highly sensitive to cadaverine, whereas Columbia root length is less sensitive to it. In general, the Columbia plants showed a range of responses to cadaverine regardless of the accession from which the transgene was derived (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref> at JXB online). This result is similar to that obtained when these constructs were transformed into the oct1-1 mutant (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). In contrast, when these constructs were transformed into Ler plants, the tested lines generally did not show increased resistance to cadaverine (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). Therefore, the ability of OCT1 to affect the cadaverine response may depend on the genetic background.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>It was found that Arabidopsis roots exhibited varying responses to exogenously applied cadaverine depending on the accession. In general, when cadaverine concentrations increased, a reduction in root length as well as alterations in skewing, lateral root branching, and root waving were seen. The reduction in root length is probably due to a combination of reduced cell division and expansion. A major QTL was identified on chromosome 1 that at least partially explains the root length difference in response to cadaverine between Cvi and Ler. By comparing phenotypes and gene expression in natural accessions, a mutant, and transgenic lines, OCT1 was identified as a key gene involved in this response. Restoring OCT1 expression in the mutant background resulted in a positive correlation between OCT1 expression levels and cadaverine resistance. Because the OCT1 expression levels in other natural accessions do not correlate well with cadaverine resistance, other indicates that expression was not detected. (B) Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 Â° backward tilt on media containing 0, 50, and 500 Î¼M cadaverine. Root tips were marked after 3 d of growth, and the root growth over the following 3 d was measured for each treatment. Average root growth over the final 3 d on control medium was 1.2 cm for the wild type, 1.4 cm for oct1-1, 1.3 cm for rescue line 1, and 1.4 cm for rescue line 2; these lengths were set to 1. For each cadaverine concentration, the letters indicate significant differences in relative root length (P&lt;0.01, pairwise Student's t-tests). n=37-68, and error bars indicate Â±SE. (C) Plants were grown for 6 d at a 30 Â° backward tilt on media containing various concentrations of polyamines as indicated. Average root length on control medium was 1.3 cm for the wild type and 1.4 cm for oct1-1; these lengths were set to 1. n=33-44, and error bars indicate Â±SE. No significant root length differences were observed for any treatment other than cadaverine (P&lt;0.05, Student's t-test).</p><p>genes are also likely to contribute to the variation of this trait between Arabidopsis accessions. These genes could contribute to endogenous cadaverine homeostasis, transport, and/or response. Unfortunately, the levels of endogenous cadaverine in Arabidopsis seedling roots and shoots were below the level of detection using HPLC methods, preventing a distinction from being made between these possibilities.</p><p>OCT1 encodes an organic cation transporter. In animals, OCT proteins take up a wide variety of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics, and, therefore, they affect substrate absorption, distribution, and excretion in many tissues. Most are polyspecific, and transport can occur in either direction (for a review, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Roth et al., 2012)</ref>. Arabidopsis OCT1 is one of six OCT-like proteins in Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lelandais-BriÃ¨re et al., 2007)</ref>. It was previously reported to localize to the plasma membrane, and promoter-Î²-glucuronidase (GUS) fusions showed activity in the vasculature of many organs including roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Lelandais-BriÃ¨re et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">KÃ¼fner and Koch, 2008)</ref>. Because the other six OCT-like proteins localize to the tonoplast rather than the plasma membrane, it is likely that OCT1 has a different function.</p><p>The present work expands on these studies and suggests a role for OCT1 in affecting root growth responses to cadaverine. Future experiments will be aimed at clarifying the mechanism by which this occurs. One possibility is that OCT1 transports cadaverine away from elongating root cells and through the vasculature, causing it to accumulate in aerial tissues. Alternatively, cadaverine may alter the transport of another molecule through the membranes. Polyamines block many kinds of channels in multiple organisms. For example, spermine and spermidine directly block fast vacuolar cation channels in barley <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bruggemann et al., 1998)</ref>, and all natural polyamines including cadaverine can regulate cation channel activity through cytoplasmic pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Liu et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Shabala et al., 2007)</ref>.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that exogenous cadaverine affects Arabidopsis root morphology and that there is natural variation in this response due in part to varying expression levels of OCT1. This work has potential implications for better understanding how polyamines contribute to development and mediate stress responses.</p><p>B C v i L e r O C T 1 C v i L i n e 1 O C T 1 C v i L i n e 2 O C T 1 L e r L i n e 1 O C T 1 L e r L i n e 2 25 20 15 10 5 0 OCT1 Expression Relative to At1g58050 A 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 Relative Root Length W S o c t 1 -1 C v i L e r O C T 1 C v i L i n e 1 O C T 1 C v i L i n e 2 O C T 1 L e r L i n e 1 O C T 1 L e r L i n e 2 0ÂµM cadaverine 50ÂµM cadaverine W S o c t 1 -1 n. d.
