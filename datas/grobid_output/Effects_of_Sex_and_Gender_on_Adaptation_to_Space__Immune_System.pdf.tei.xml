<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>To address urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 , this review describes experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence that suggests that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before infection might increase risk of COVID-19 mortality in multiple ways. Sub-optimal hydration is associated with key risk factors for COVID-19 mortality, including older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and chronic disease. Chronic hypertonicity, total body water deficit and/or hypovolemia cause multiple intracellular and/or physiologic adaptations that preferentially retain body water and favor positive total body water balance when challenged by infection. Via effects on serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) signaling, aldosterone, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), aquaporin 5 (AQP5) and/or Na + /K + -ATPase, chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before exposure to COVID-19 may conceivably result in: greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection, lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune response, increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or reduced capacity for both passive and active transport of fluid out of the airways. The hypothesized hydration effects suggest hypotheses regarding strategies for COVID-19 risk reduction, such as public health recommendations to increase intake of drinking water, hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and treatment tailored to the pre-infection hydration condition. Hydration may link risk factors and pathways in a unified mechanism for COVID-19 mortality. Attention to hydration holds potential to reduce COVID-19 mortality and disparities via at least 5 pathways simultaneously.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Background</head><p>There is an urgent need for strategies to limit mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. Coronavirus is expected to infect up to 70% of the world's population and kill millions of people <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. To date, the main public health strategy for limiting mortality, to reduce exposure to the virus via physical distancing, carries tremendous economic costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and may create COVID-19 disparities, as not everyone can telecommute for work or afford to shelter in place <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The main treatment strategy for limiting mortality involves ventilators, which may not be available and accessible in adequate quantities <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. To address need for strategies that are less costly, more equitable, and more accessible, this paper describes potential causal paths from suboptimal hydration before COVID-19 infection to increased morbidity and mortality. The hypothesized mechanisms suggest potential for free or low-cost, globally applicable drinking water interventions and hydration-informed treatment (e.g. hypertonic resuscitation) to limit COVID-19 mortality. breathe <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>." Death from ARDS is strongly associated with positive total body water (TBW) balance, i.e. body water retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> (see Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Risk factors for COVID-19 death</head><p>Death from COVID-19 is strongly associated with older age, male sex, and age-related chronic health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. The United States (US) Centers for Disease Control (CDC) highlights the following risk factors: residence in a nursing home or long-term care facility, chronic lung disease or moderate to severe asthma, serious heart conditions, severe obesity (body mass index &gt; 40), diabetes, renal failure, liver disease, and/or weakened immune system due to cancer treatment, smoking, bone marrow or organ transplantation, immune deficiencies, poorly controlled HIV or AIDS, and prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In the US and United Kingdom (UK), consistent with obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease disparities, ethnic minorities are at increased risk of dying from COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</p><p>Although not specified on the CDC's list of risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, given the ARDS literature (e.g. Rahmel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>), a propensity to retain body water when stressed or challenged is partially recognized as a risk factor for COVID-19 ARDS death. Recommendations for COVID-19 ARDS treatment explicitly aim to achieve a negative fluid balance of 0.5-1.0 L/d <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This paper posits that attention to hydration may not only increase the success of treatment for ARDS but may also prevent the development of ARDS and positive fluid balance during COVID-19 infection, in the first place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hypothesized mechanism</head><p>This paper hypothesizes that, compared to people who survive COVID-19, people who die from COVID-19 have too much fluid accumulating in their lungs, in part because of chronic suboptimal hydration before infection with COVID-19. Chronic hypertonic stress causes a wide variety of metabolic and physiologic adaptations throughout the body <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which alter intracellular composition and response to subsequent hypo-osmotic challenge. Infection triggers an inflammatory response which signals body water retention and vessel dilation, creating relatively hypotonic conditions. Chronic hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia in the weeks before COVID-19 infection are hypothesized to result in one or more adaptations, including:</p><p>• Greater abundance of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) re- ceptors in the lung, which increases likelihood of COVID-19 infection.</p><p>• Lung epithelial cells which are pre-set for exaggerated immune re- sponse.</p><p>• Increased capacity for capillary leakage of fluid into the airway space.</p><p>• Reduced capacity for active transport of fluid out of the airways.</p><p>• Reduced capacity for passive transport of fluid out of the airways.</p><p>Fluid accumulating in the lungs results from an imbalance between passive and active forces driving fluid into the airspaces and mechanisms removing fluid from the airspace <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The multiplicity of factors influencing the balance of forces suggests need for intervention strategies that attend to multiple factors, simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Evidence motivating the hypotheses</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overview</head><p>The rationale begins by linking the CDC's list of risk factors for COVID-19 death with increased likelihood of suboptimal hydration, expressed in terms of hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia. Suboptimal hydration is, next, linked with each of the adaptations, listed above, by experimental, clinical, and epidemiological evidence. Metabolic intermediates or pathways that mediate effects of suboptimal hydration are identified. Experiments and clinical trials that intervene against these mechanisms and increase survival from ARDS are described.</p></div>

In population-representative datasets, a majority of older adults have plasma hypertonicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. In the US, hypertonicity is significantly more frequent among males than females <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and among Black or African Americans and Hispanics compared to Asians (78-79% vs 55%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Hypovolemia is common among residents of nursing home or long-term care facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</p><p>Hypertonicity is associated with chronic disease risk factors for COVID-19 death. The prevalence of hypertonicity in non-acutely ill US adults ages 51-70 years who have obesity, high waist circumference, insulin resistance, diabetes, hyperglycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, dyslipidemia, hypertension and/or metabolic syndrome is 73%, compared to 56% among individuals without any of the listed conditions, in the same age group <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Systematic review of observational studies suggests that hypernatremia is consistently associated with metabolic syndrome <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.

Hypovolemia is an established risk factor for renal failure in the ICU <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</p><p>Beyond older age, male sex, race-ethnicity and metabolic syndrome, hypertonicity and/or hypovolemia are also associated with asthma, liver disease, and impaired immune function, other risk factors for COVID-19 death highlighted by the CDC <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma is associated with hypertonicity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Acute suboptimal hydration</head><p>Acute extracellular hypertonicity causes water to shift out of cells following the osmotic gradient via aquaporin channels. The cell shrinkage increases intracellular solute concentrations, which activate the Na + ,K + -ATPase, Na + ,K + ,2Cl -co-transporter and the Na + / H + exchanger, which couple to Cl -/H2CO3, to enhance cellular osmolarity and restore cell volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</p><p>At the whole-person level, acute hypertonic shrinkage of osmoreceptor cells and/or hypovolemia activate the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Acute hypertonicity triggers release of arginine vasopressin, also known as antidiuretic hormone, which stimulates thirst and signals the kidney to concentrate urine and reduce urine volume. Acute hypovolemia triggers the kidney to produce renin, which stimulates the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin 1 (Ang I) in the liver and the conversion of Ang I to angiotensin II (Ang II) by the angiotension-converting enzyme (ACE) in multiple organs, including the lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Ang II causes vasoconstriction and secretion of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Aldosterone binds to mineralocorticoid receptors and stimulates renal and intestinal sodium reabsorption by upregulating ENaC and Na + , K + -ATPase.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Chronic suboptimal hydration</head><p>At the cell level, chronic hypertonicity shifts metabolism to favor pathways that accumulate metabolic end-products (osmolytes) of low molecular weight inside the cell. The increased osmolyte concentrations create an osmotic gradient that drives water into the cell. Hypertonic conditions alter the expression of multiple genes. Hypertonicity activates tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP), also known as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT5), which coordinates increases in the expression of organic osmolyte transporters and enzymes such as aldose reductase (AR), betaine/GABA transporter (BGT1), sodium myoinositol transporter (SMIT) and taurine transporter (TauT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. Hypertonic conditions induced by high-salt diet decrease expression of renal renin and angiotensinogen-mRNAs compared to normal-and low-salt diets <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.

Crossover experiments in healthy volunteers report that infusion of 25 ml/kg of a relatively hypertonic solution (osmolarity 614 mOsm/l; tonicity 373 mOsm/l) significantly decreases plasma aldosterone relative to the same volume of a hypotonic solution (osmolarity 447 mOsm/l; tonicity 169 mOsm/l) <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In controlled experiments in healthy humans, hypertonic saline infusion decreases plasma aldosterone and free water clearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>.</p><p>In healthy young men with urine osmolality over 800 mmol/kg under conditions of daily life, chronic hypertonicity and mild (&lt; 2%) TBW deficit appear associated with metabolic and physiologic adaptations that result in water retention in response to hypotonic challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. Four weeks of sustained higher intake of drinking water (&gt; +1L/ d) is associated with a mean (SE) decrease in HOMA-IR of 2.2 (0.2) to 1.7 (0.1), a mean (SE) increase in plasma aldosterone from 111 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> pg/ ml to 143 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> pg/ml and an average (SE) increase in body weight of +1.8 (0.5) percent <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.

Evidence from in-vitro, animal, clinical and epidemiological studies suggest that chronic plasma hypertonicity, TBW deficit and/or hypovolemia may increase the likelihood of COVID-19 infection, pre-set the body for exaggerated immune response, increase tissue damage and leakage of fluid into the airway space, and/or decrease capacity for active and passive transport of fluid out of the airway space.</p><p>Taken together, the evidence suggests that strategies to limit COVID-19 mortality may need to account for multiple determinants of water retention, fluid entry into and fluid removal out of the lungs, simultaneously. The mechanism(s) described above suggest testable hypotheses regarding screening to identify at-risk groups, public health recommendations to limit risk, and clinical treatment protocol. The preinfection hydration condition is measurable by biomarkers and modifiable by drinking water. The United Nations imperative to have drinking water be available and accessible, worldwide [148], might be leveraged for COVID-19 risk reduction. Attention to hydration by clinicians, researchers and public health authorities has potential to block at least 5 pathways to COVID morbidity and holds promise to prevent death due to COVID-19.</p><p>Grant support None.</p></div>

SGK1: Human SGK1 gene expression analysis by qPCR. Total RNA from human whole blood was isolated using PAXgene Blood miRNA extraction kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentrations were estimated by Nanodrop. Equal amounts of RNA were retro-transcribed to cDNA using cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad). The resultant cDNA was used as template in quantitative PCR reactions containing SYBR-green fluorescent dye (Bio-Rad). Human SGK1 relative expression levels were calculated using the 2^-delta Ct method. Human actin (hActin) expression was used for SGK1 normalization. Target primer (5′-3′) sequences for SGK1 were TTC TCT TTC CAG ACT GCT GA and TGG ATG TTG TGC TGT </p></div>			</div>
