<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the repeated cycles of damage and repair in many muscle disorders, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the muscle stem cell (MuSC) pool becomes less efficient at responding to and repairing damage. The underlying mechanism of such stem cell dysfunction is not fully known. Here, we demonstrate that the distinct early telomere shortening of diseased MuSCs in both mice and young DMD patients is associated with aberrant NF-κB activation. We find that prolonged NF-κB activation in MuSCs in chronic injuries leads to shortened telomeres and Ku80 dysregulation and results in severe skeletal muscle defects. Our studies provide evidence of a role for NF-κB in regulating stem-cell-specific telomere length, independently of cell replication, and could be a congruent mechanism that is applicable to additional tissues and/or diseases characterized by systemic chronic inflammation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The stages of skeletal muscle regeneration are well characterized following injury, starting with necrosis of damaged muscle tissue and the infiltration of immune cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Frenette et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Tidball, 2005)</ref>. Inflammatory signals both directly and indirectly lead to activation of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs; also called satellite cells), which respond to muscle damage by population expansion, followed by selective differentiation into myogenic progeny <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chazaud et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Tidball and Wehling-Henricks, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal X-linked degenerative muscle disease, and it is among the most common lethally inherited disorders in children <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Emery, 2002)</ref>. DMD is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which codes for a cytoskeletal protein that acts as a crucial bridging protein between the sarcomere and extracellular matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hoffman et al., 1987)</ref>. The complete or partial loss of dystrophin in muscular dystrophies impairs the ability of the muscle to contract and causes the muscle to break down. This acts as constant injury to the muscle that progressively affects the MuSC pool <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Morgan and Zammit, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sacco et al., 2010)</ref>, presumably due to an autonomous dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dumont et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus, MuSC function is severely affected in DMD, and although the disease is initiated by dystrophin deficiency, it is ultimately a stem cell disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dumont et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sacco et al., 2010)</ref>. Previous work showed that accelerated telomere shortening occurs in muscular dystrophy in both skeletal muscle and cardiomyopathy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Mourkioti et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sacco et al., 2010)</ref>. Recent studies have also revealed that MuSCs derived either from dystrophic mice or young DMD patients exhibit critically shortened telomeres early on during disease progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tichy et al., 2017)</ref>. These observations suggest that modulation or maintenance of MuSC function can prevent or diminish destructive muscle processes in chronic injury conditions. However, the molecular mechanisms contributing to MuSC-specific telomere shortening are currently unknown.</p><p>Here, we show that persistent activation of nuclear factor kb (NF-κB) leads to telomere shortening in MuSCs under chronic injury conditions, and it is independent of proliferation. Instead, this mechanism involves Ku80 dysregulation and increased DNA damage, specifically on telomeres, that results in MuSC loss and, subsequently, skeletal muscle regenerative failure. Overall, our findings propose a previously unrecognized role of NF-κB in regulating MuSC dysfunction by affecting telomeres, a key event during the progression of DMD.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NF-κB is dysregulated in dystrophic MuSCs</head><p>To understand the mechanisms that affect telomere length and function in diseased MuSCs, we assayed their internal signaling pathways by flow cytometry (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). We found that a higher proportion of the MuSCs from dystrophic mice exhibited higher NF-κB activation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>) and accumulation of p-p65 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). We expanded upon these observations by assessing the timing of NF-κB activation following a single intramuscular injury. Muscle injury rapidly increases NF-κB activation in MuSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). But in dystrophic mice, p-p65+ MuSCs are more numerous at all time points, including baseline conditions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>). Hence, the inherent endogenous injuries observed in dystrophic mice induce a constant elevated NF-κB signaling response in MuSCs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MuSC-specific NF-κB activation does not alter muscles in non-injured conditions</head><p>To examine the in vivo impact of persistent NF-κB activation in regulating telomere length in MuSCs during chronic injury, we generated a mouse that allows expression of a constitutively active (CA) form of the IKK2 gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Calado et al., 2010)</ref> specifically in MuSCs (Pax7 ERT2Cre /IKK2CA or IKK2CA MuSC ) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1A</ref>). To generate mice in which NF-κB signaling is abrogated in MuSCs, we crossed mice carrying a floxed allele of the NF-κB regulator NEMO <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Schmidt-Supprian et al., 2000)</ref> with the same Pax7 ERT2Cre mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Murphy et al., 2011)</ref> to generate NEMO knockout (NEMOKO MuSC ) mice. Characterization of these mice demonstrates that we obtained &gt;90% Cre recombination efficiency after seven daily intraperitoneal tamoxifen injections, which resulted in significant upregulation of the IKK2 gene in IKK2CA MuSC mice and downregulation in NEMOKO MuSC mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1B</ref>). The above genetic approaches allow for CA or inactivation of p65 in MuSCs, as shown by flow cytometry analysis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Enforced expression of activated IKK2 alone or ablation of NEMO in MuSCs had no effect on muscle morphology (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1C</ref>), muscle size (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1D</ref>), function (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1E</ref>), and/or telomere length (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1F</ref>) under steadystate conditions. These data suggest that in the absence of injury, persistent activation of MuSC-specific NF-κB has minimal effects in skeletal muscles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rapid telomere shortening in injured MuSCs with persistent NF-κB</head><p>To investigate the importance of injury in NF-κB-dependent telomere length regulation and to mimic the rounds of degeneration/regeneration occurring in the dystrophic condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Morgan and Zammit, 2010)</ref>, we implemented a multiple injury model in control, IKK2CA MuSC , and NEMOKO MuSC mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Assessment of telomere lengths of MuSCs isolated from these mice by MuQ-FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tichy et al., 2017)</ref> uncovered a propensity of telomere shortening in IKK2CA MuSC -derived MuSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>). However, NEMOKO MuSC MuSCs have unaltered telomere lengths even after many injuries (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>), demonstrating that NF-kB inhibition maintains telomere length. These findings further suggest that NF-κB activation is required for telomere shortening in injured muscles, providing strong support that prolonged NF-κB activation drives telomere shortening under chronic injuries. Interestingly, telomeres start to shorten after three injuries in IKK2CA MuSC cells, but this reduction becomes more severe with an increasing number of injuries . Moreover, the progressive telomere shortening observed after an increased number of injuries correlates well with the worsening histology (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2G-2I</ref>) and fibrosis (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2C</ref>) in IKK2CA MuSC muscles with an increased number of injuries. These studies support the notion that NF-κBdependent telomere shortening contributes to the histopathology in skeletal muscles under repetitive injuries. Altogether, these data demonstrate an unconventional role for unrestrained NF-κB signaling in MuSCs to promote telomere attrition and impairment of regeneration under chronic injury conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Telomere shortening in MuSCs is not caused by enhanced proliferation</head><p>In proliferative cells, DNA polymerases fail to completely replicate telomeres following each cell division, which eventually leads to critical telomere shortening <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lee et al., 1998)</ref>. To address whether the rapid MuSC-specific telomere shortening observed in injured IKK2CA MuSC mice was caused by MuSC proliferative changes, we injured control or IKK2CA MuSC mice repeatedly. At 3 days after the last injury, a timepoint considered the peak of MuSC proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Morgan and Zammit, 2010)</ref>, mice were pulsed in vivo with the nucleotide analog 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) to label cells undergoing DNA replication (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). In uninjured muscles, only a small portion of MuSCs was EdU + (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>), consistent with the notion that adult MuSCs with higher NF-kB activation are largely quiescent under steady-state conditions. Interestingly, upon injury, both control and IKK2CA MuSC MuSCs were proliferating at comparable rates <ref type="bibr">(Figures 3B and 3C)</ref>. Similarly, an equivalent level of the proliferation marker Ki67, in combination with the stem cell marker Pax7 was found in injured control and IKK2CA MuSC muscles (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3D</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>). To ensure that the window of optimal in vivo proliferation was not missed by our previous assessments, as well as to confirm a large enough window of EdU incorporation was included, EdU was administered daily, for a total of three times, and MuSCs were harvested 3 or 5 days after the last injury (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>). Similar to the previous data, no significant increases in proliferation were evident in IKK2CA MuSC MuSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3G</ref>). We conclude that in contrast to other cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sasaki et al., 2006)</ref>, the constant activation of NF-κB in MuSCs does not result in higher rates of proliferation even under injury conditions. Altogether, these data unequivocally demonstrate a proliferation-independent mechanism of NF-κB to drive MuSC-specific telomere shortening.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>NF-κB regulates Ku80 expression in MuSCs in chronic muscle injuries</head><p>Telomeres are not naked DNA but are instead associated with six proteins, called shelterins (TIN2, TPP1, POT1, RAP1, TRF1, and TRF2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(de Lange, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hsu et al., 1999)</ref>, together with the DNA-binding proteins <ref type="bibr">Kus (de Lange, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hsu et al., 1999)</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A</ref>). To delineate alternative mechanisms to rationalize the observed telomere shortening in IKK2CA MuSC MuSCs experiencing chronic injuries, we carried out in-silico analysis on promoters of genes, whose proteins are known to reside at telomeres. Given that Kus bind to telomeres, aid the localization of other shelterins, and regulate telomere length, we included them in our in-silico analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(de Lange, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hsu et al., 1999)</ref>. NF-κB functions by binding to promoter and enhancer regions containing kB sites to regulate gene expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dong et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hayden and Ghosh, 2004)</ref>. We found that proteins bound to telomeric DNA contain kB sites in their promoters (Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>), raising the intriguing possibility that NF-κB-dependent regulation of telomere binding proteins may have a significant impact on telomere length in MuSCs. We then performed qRT-PCR to validate the in-silico analysis and detected downregulation of telomeric XRCC5/Ku80 gene expression in MuSCs from injured muscles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>), while all other telomeric genes had no significant differences (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). Similarly, we found downregulation of Ku80 protein in MuSCs from IKK2CA MuSC muscles after 3× injury (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>), further demonstrating the NF-κB-dependent regulation of Ku80. In addition, we found undetectable tert levels in wild-type (WT) or IKK2CA MuSC MuSCs either in steady-state or upon injury conditions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3B</ref>). Since tert transcripts are detectable in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) within the same reaction (technical control), our data suggest that tert is either present at very low (undetectable) levels or expressed transiently in freshly isolated MuSCs, in contrast to what is known for cancer cell lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Yin et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zuo et al., 2011)</ref>. Importantly, Ku80 levels are unchanged in both IKK2CA uninjured MuSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3C</ref>; NF-κB activation alone without injury) and MuSCs from NEMOKO MuSC injured mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3D</ref>; injury combined with NF-κB inactivation in MuSCs), demonstrating that NF-κB is required during injury to alter Ku80 levels (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4C</ref>) and induce telomere shortening (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C-2F</ref>). Overall, these data indicate a previously unrecognized requirement of NF-κB in regulating Ku80 expression associated with telomere length in freshly isolated MuSCs from injured muscles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MuSC telomere shortening leads to increased DNA damage in telomeres and stem cell exhaustion over time</head><p>In mammalian cells, DNA damage, in the form of double-stranded DNA breaks, is typically repaired by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mao et al., 2008)</ref> and depends on the activity of Ku80 to recognize damaged DNA ends <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Koike and Koike, 2008)</ref>. Indeed, we observed a higher number of centralized nuclei in regenerating IKK2CA MuSC fibers that positively stained for the DNA damage marker 53BP1 (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3E</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3F</ref>). Extensive telomere shortening can be recognized by DNA damage sensors as free DNA ends <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Hsu et al., 2000)</ref>. In fact, we did observe increased numbers of telomere-induced foci (TIFs) in chronically injured IKK2CA MuSC MuSCs (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>), as identified by the stem cell marker, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3G</ref>). These data are in agreement with the notion that telomere dysfunction is governed by proteins that also control DNA damage response <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Takai et al., 2003)</ref>.</p><p>To further investigate the in vivo consequence of the early telomere shortening in MuSCs in chronic injury, we crossed the MuSC-specific IKK2CA MuSC mice with Pax7EGFP reporter mice, which express EGFP under the control of the Pax7 promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Tichy et al., 2018)</ref>. The Pax7EGFP/IKK2CA MuSC mouse allows for direct visualization and evaluation of MuSCs in their native environment on all fibers within the same animal in a spatiotemporal manner. Utilizing this method, we assessed the number of MuSCs by two-photon microscopy following chronic injury and recovery. We found that the number of MuSCs decreases over time in Pax7EGFP/IKK2CA MuSC skeletal muscles (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>), indicative of an exhaustion of the stem cell pool under chronic injury.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MuSC-specific NF-κB activation exacerbates the dystrophic muscle defects</head><p>To explore whether MuSC-specific activation of NF-κB could exacerbate the progression of dystrophy, we crossed IKK 2CA MuSC mice with a dystrophin mutant mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Im et al., 1996)</ref>. The resulting double mutants are designated herein as mdx/IKK2CA MuSC . These mice have higher muscle damage, shown by the levels of creatine kinase (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>), an established damage diagnostic indicator in DMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Zatz et al., 1991)</ref>. The severity of muscle defects in mdx/IKK2CA MuSC mice is consistent with reduced muscle weight (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4A</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4B</ref>), worse muscle morphology (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4C</ref>), and reduced area of fibers with centralized nuclei (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4D</ref>). Interestingly, we observed substantial kyphosis (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>), a classical clinical manifestation of DMD due to weakness of trunk muscles <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Oda et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wilkins and Gibson, 1976)</ref> and impaired muscle performance in mdx/IKK2CA MuSC mice compared to mdx controls (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>). Importantly, MuSCs isolated from mdx/IKK2CA MuSC mice exhibited higher levels of p65 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>), demonstrated shortened telomeres (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4E</ref>), exhibited increased numbers of TIFs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5G</ref>), and had a reduced number of MuSCs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4F</ref>). We conclude that the persistent activation of NF-κB in MuSCs in the context of repetitive injuries as caused by the lack of dystrophin leads to the aggravation of the mdx phenotype, imitating the human disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Downregulation of Ku80 alone or in the context of chronic injuries reduces telomere length in MuSCs</head><p>To gain more insight into the involvement of Ku80 in telomere shortening in myogenic cells, we first investigated telomere length in the C2C12 mouse myoblast cell line (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5A</ref>). Using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors targeting XRCC5, which encodes the Ku80 protein, we observed significant knockdown at the protein level when compared to cells transfected with empty vector (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5B</ref>). Upon performing MuQ-FISH, we uncovered that Ku80 downregulation is sufficient to induce telomere shortening in myogenic cells with two different shRNAs <ref type="bibr">(Figures S5C and S5D)</ref>. These data demonstrate that downregulation of Ku80 alone is sufficient to reduce telomere length in myogenic cells. Next, we extended our findings by investigating the effect of Ku80 manipulation on telomere length in vivo, utilizing a Ku80 heterozygous mouse line <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Zhu et al., 1996)</ref>. We found that MuSCs derived from this mouse exhibited only ~20% reduction of Ku80 protein expression compared to Ku80 WT littermates (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5E</ref>). Nevertheless, we still observed a reduction in telomere lengths of these Ku80 heterozygous mice after 3× injury (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5F</ref>), suggesting that even a mild reduction of Ku80 protein is sufficient to shorten telomeres in MuSCs. To further demonstrate the involvement of Ku80 in telomere length modulation in vivo in more severe chronic injuries, we bred mdx mice with Ku80 +/-mice. Interestingly, MuSCs in the mdx/ Ku80 +/-muscles have a pronounced shift toward shorter telomeres (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5G</ref>), increased muscle damage (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5H</ref>), and impaired muscle performance (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5I</ref>). These data suggest that the mdx/Ku80 +/-mice exhibit similar muscle defects as the ones seen in mdx/ IKK2CA MuSC mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Altogether, these results demonstrate that Ku80 is a major regulator of telomere length in myogenic cells, both in vitro and in vivo, either alone or in the context of dystrophy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ku80 dysregulation and telomere damage in human dystrophic MuSCs</head><p>We next investigated whether our mouse findings recapitulate what happens in the human dystrophic condition. We found that human DMD MuSCs express significantly higher levels of p-p65 (Figures <ref type="figure">6A</ref> and <ref type="figure">6B</ref>), and a larger portion is localized in the nucleus (Figure <ref type="figure">6C</ref>), further supporting the notion of persistent elevated NF-κB signaling in dystrophic human MuSCs. Interestingly, human DMD MuSCs have significantly decreased Ku80 levels (Figures <ref type="figure">6D</ref> and <ref type="figure">6E</ref>), as shown by immunohistochemistry analysis on human muscles from DMD patients. Furthermore, in corroboration with the mouse data, we found shortened telomeres (Figure <ref type="figure">6F</ref>), higher levels of DNA damage (Figures <ref type="figure">S6A</ref> and <ref type="figure">S6B</ref>), and increased numbers of TIFs (Figures <ref type="figure">6G</ref> and <ref type="figure">6H</ref>) in human diseased MuSCs compared to aged-matched healthy controls. Altogether, these striking human findings, which are consistent with the mouse results, provide further evidence that persistent NF-κB activation specifically in MuSCs leads to Ku80 dysregulation and predisposes these cells to premature telomere shortening and an increased number of TIFs that ultimately contribute to the severe dystrophic skeletal muscle phenotype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Previous work had revealed that MuSCs progressively become dysfunctional in dystrophy, and telomere shortening is a major hallmark of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Dumont et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Sacco et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Tichy et al., 2017)</ref>. Here, we provide evidence of the in vivo molecular basis for telomere shortening of stem cells under chronic injury conditions. These findings provide insights into the fundamental regulatory mechanisms of MuSC-specific telomere shortening under chronic injuries.</p><p>Indications of perturbation of NF-κB signaling exist in various muscle diseases, such as muscle atrophy conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cai et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mourkioti et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mourkioti and Rosenthal, 2008)</ref>, cancer cachexia <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(He et al., 2013)</ref>, dystrophinopathies such as Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2A (LGMD2A) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baghdiguian et al., 1999)</ref>, and DMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Acharyya et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hammers et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Messina et al., 2011)</ref>. In addition to its role in regulating myogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mourkioti and Rosenthal, 2008)</ref>, NF-κB is likely to modulate immune responses, muscle damage, and repair in DMD as well as in other muscle disorders. However, the survival effect of NF-κB in LGMD2A muscles, compared with its rather negative contribution in DMD, reflects the complexity of this pathway in chronic muscle diseases. Previous genetically modified animal models generated to interfere with NF-κB signaling only assessed NF-κB function regarding cancer cachexia <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(He et al., 2013)</ref> and aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Oh et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Proto et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>By targeting the MuSC compartment in adult mice, we demonstrate that the inherent endogenous injuries observed in dystrophic mice induce a constant elevated NF-κB signaling response in MuSCs in both mdx and, most importantly, in human DMD MuSCs. Furthermore, we showed that persistent MuSC-specific NF-κB activation in injured muscles leads to telomere shortening and impairment of regeneration, as shown by the worsened histopathology of skeletal muscles during the progression of the chronic injury.</p><p>Additionally, we demonstrate that persistent MuSC-specific NF-κB activation in injured muscles drives telomere shortening via a mechanism that does not raise proliferation levels. Instead, we describe an NF-κB-dependent Ku80 dysregulation and increased DNA damage on telomeres in MuSCs from both dystrophic mice and human patients. While the effects of Ku80 in NHEJ are well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fell and Schild-Poulter, 2015)</ref>, its potential mechanistic involvement in telomere length alteration is less clear. Indeed, the absence of Ku80 has been associated with both telomere lengthening and shortening, depending on the cell line used; the organism (i.e., yeast, Drosophila, mouse, plant); or the context (embryonic development, cancer, or aging) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boulton and Jackson, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chai et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">d'Adda di Fagagna et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Didier et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Espejel et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Gallego et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Indiviglio and Bertuch, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Li et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Melnikova et al., 2005)</ref>. Furthermore, it is still unclear when Ku80 could function alone or as a heterodimer of both Ku80 and Ku70 subunits <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fell and Schild-Poulter, 2015)</ref>. It was previously shown that loss of a single allele of Ku80 leads to dysfunction of muscle-derived cells and accelerated aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Didier et al., 2012)</ref>. In this study, we demonstrate that NF-κB regulates Ku80 expression in MuSCs in chronic muscle injuries and dystrophic muscles in both mouse and human. This NF-kB-dependent in vivo telomere regulatory mechanism is different from the modulation of telomeric proteins Tert or Rap1 that have been shown in cancer cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Teo et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Yin et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Zuo et al., 2011)</ref>. Additional work, to generate more targeted molecular tools for Kus and to investigate the exact role of Ku80 in the regulation of telomere integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Indiviglio and Bertuch, 2009)</ref>, will be instrumental in order to identify other contributing molecular mechanisms and to develop concepts that could maintain MuSC telomere length under injured conditions.</p><p>It has been suggested that MuSCs could not keep up with the high regeneration demand under chronic injury conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sacco et al., 2010)</ref>. However, other studies have shown that MuSC numbers are elevated in mdx muscles in mice or DMD patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Boldrin et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Dumont et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kottlors and Kirschner, 2010)</ref>. All these studies were dependent on prospective cell isolation methods, which rely on enzymatic digestion efficiency, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) based on cell-surface markers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tichy et al., 2017)</ref> or ex vivo methods to isolate single muscle fibers, in combination with Pax7 antibody staining <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sacco et al., 2010)</ref>. Both methods result in cell loss due to either incomplete tissue digestion and/or cell death during these long procedures, and the cell loss is likely exacerbated in diseased muscles that are inherently more fibrotic and fragile. Additionally, only the intact/non-broken fibers are used for quantification and, therefore, single-fiber isolation selects for MuSC measurements in somewhat "healthier" fibers. To overcome these limitations and to evaluate the consequences of telomere shortening in MuSCs, we used the Pax7EGFP reporter mouse <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Tichy et al., 2018)</ref> to study changes in the number of MuSCs during disease conditions. Our analysis revealed that there is a loss of MuSC over time in both the IKK2CA MuSC after repetitive injuries and the mdx/IKK2CA MuSC mice, which contributes to the muscle regeneration impairment seen in the context of chronic injuries as caused by the lack of dystrophin.</p><p>In summary, this study establishes a link between stem cell functional exhaustion and NF-κB-dependent telomere shortening. Our data suggest that maintaining telomere length of MuSCs could boost the regenerative ability of MuSCs in disease-related chronic injuries such as DMD. It was recently proposed that chronic inflammation can accelerate aging via exacerbation of telomere dysfunction in multiple tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Jurk et al., 2014)</ref>. Therefore, the molecular mechanism presented here for DMD could also be a more generalized mechanism that lowers regenerative potential in other tissues with systemic chronic inflammation and/or accelerates normal and pathological aging.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHOD DETAILS</head><p>Muscle stem cell isolation-MuSCs were FACS-isolated as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tichy et al., 2017)</ref>. Briefly mice were sacrificed, and the tibialis anterior, quadriceps and gastrocnemius muscles were dissected from both hind limbs. Muscle was finely minced and placed in a C tube (Miltenyi) containing 0.15% collagenase in 10 mL DMEM. Tubes were loaded into a MACS Dissociator (Miltenyi) and the manufacturer's muscle-01 program was run. Tubes were incubated in at 37°C for 30 min, subjected to the muscle-01 program again, and incubated at 37°C for an additional 30min. Seventy-five microliters of 2% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 75 μL of 4.8 U/mL dispase (Roche) was added, and tubes were vortexed at maximum speed prior to a 30min incubation at 37°C. Cells were passed through a 21-gauge needle until all muscle was broken apart. The remaining cell slurry was filtered through a 40 μM cell strainer that was prewet with 10 mL of cold myoblast media (DMEM:F12; 15% FBS, 1X anti-anti) the strainer was rinsed with an additional 10 mL of cold myoblast media, and cells were pelleted at 300xg/4°C. Cells were incubated with 1mL 1X red cell lysis buffer (ThermoFisher) for 5 min at room temperature and 9 mL cold FACS buffer (2.5% goat serum, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 in 1X PBS) was added. Cells were spun and resuspended in 1mL of FACS buffer containing biotin-conjugated antibodies raised against antigens CD45, CD31, CD11b, and Sca1 prior to an incubation on ice for 45 min. Cells were centrifuged and resuspended in 100 μL of FACS buffer containing antibodies CD34, and α7integrin, as well as streptavidin-PE-Cy7. Cells were incubated in the dark for 90 min on ice, with agitation occurring every 30 min. FACS buffer was added up to 1 mL final volume, and cells pelleted and resuspended in FACS buffer, and the viability dye 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) was added (final concentration 4 mg/mL). Cells were placed in falcon tubes with cell strainers before collection by FACS. Murine MuSCs were identified as CD11b -/CD31 -/ CD45 -/Sca1 -/α7-Integrin + /CD34 + . Primary human MuSCs were provided as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tichy et al., 2017)</ref>. Briefly, human calf muscle biopsies were enzymatically dissociated in 0.2% collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.02 units/mL dispase (Roche) for 45 min at 37°C, minced under a dissection microscope and incubated for an additional 45 min at 37°C. The resulting cell suspension was filtered through a 70 μm cell strainer and incubated with biotinylated anti-human CD45, CD11b and CD31. Samples were washed with FACS buffer and incubated with anti-NCAM/CD56 and Streptavidin APC-Cy7. Human MuSCs were CD11b -/CD31 -/CD45 -/NCAM + .</p><p>Flow cytometry-FACS-isolated MuSCs from age and sex-matched animals were fixed in 1.6% PFA/PBS for 10' on ice, spun at 350xg at 4°C, and stored in cold 100% methanol (final concentration 90%) at -80°C until the staining commenced. MuSCs were further permeabilized in 1% Igepal CA-630/PBS, washed with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100, and stained with phospho-p65 antibody (Abcam, 1/500), or phospho-JNK (1/100, Cell Signaling), phospho-p38 (1/100, BD Biosciences), phospho-S6K (1/100, Cell Signaling), phospho-AKT (1/100, Cell Signaling), or Bcl2 (1/100, BD Biosciences) in 1%BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100 overnight at 4°C in V-bottom 96-well plates. MuSCs were washed in BSA buffer, stained with goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (Thermo, 1/500), and analyzed on an LSRII flow cytometer using the 488nm laser line 530/30 bandpass filter set. Data were analyzed with FlowJo. Unbiased analysis was performed with the investigators blinded to genotypes and/or conditions. Results were consistent and reproducible with different batches of Abs, using MuSC isolation from different experimental mice performed on different days. Antibody specificity was determined by several methods, including using unstained controls, no primary antibody-stained controls, and FMO controls.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Muscle isolation and sectioning-Tibialis</head><p>Anterior muscles were dissected and fixed in 4% PFA/PBS and incubated overnight in 30% sucrose prior to being embedded in OCT medium (Richard Allen Scientific) and frozen in chilled 2-methylbutane. Cryosections were cut at a thickness of 10 μm and placed on Superfrost plus slides. Sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. More specifically, slides were stained with Hematoxylin for 1min, rinsed in water, and incubated with acidic alcohol (1% hydrochloric acid in 100% ethanol). After rinsing in water, slides were immersed in bluing, water, and 70% ethanol for 30sec each. Next, slides were exposed to eosin for 1min and gradually dehydrated with a graduated ethanol series. After a final incubation in xylene, coverslips were mounted with Cytosealxyl. Sections were imaged on a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope. Muscle fiber areas were manually determined using ImageJ/Fiji.</p><p>Immunofluorescence staining-Isolated cells or tissue cryosections were permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS for 10min and washed with PBS. If Pax7 staining was required, sections were processed as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Tichy et al. (2018)</ref>. Primary antibodies for phospho-p65 (1/100; Abcam), Ki67 (1/250; Abcam) and/or 53BP1 (1/1000; Novus Biologicals) were incubated overnight at 4°C in antibody dilution buffer (1% BSA/PBS/ 0.1% Triton X-100). Secondary antibodies used were: Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 647conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit staining (1/300-500 in antibody dilution buffer) for 1hr in the dark at room temperature. For quantifications in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, p-p65 expression represent nuclear signal intensities normalized to DAPI intensities, to account for any possible differences in cell cycle position or nuclear size. A negative staining control (with no primary antibody) was included to further demonstrate the specificity of the p-p65 staining. For human sections, 10um formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skeletal muscle from young normal donors or DMD patients were deparaffinized and rehydrated by standard procedures. Samples were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X100/PBS, underwent heatmediated antigen retrieval with acidic citrate, and were blocked first with the avidin/biotin blocking kit (Vector Labs), then with 3% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were stained with Ku80 antibody (Proteintech) and Pax7 (Santa Cruz) overnight at 4°C in 1% BSA/PBS/0.1% Triton X-100. Slides were washed with PBS and the Pax7 signal was amplified with a mouse-on mouse kit (Vector labs). Sections were stained with Alexa Fluor 488 Goat anti-Rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated streptavidin for 1hr. All slides washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with prolong gold with DAPI. Sections were imaged with a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope under the same conditions and intensities of Ku80 in Pax7 cells were normalized to controls.</p><p>Trichrome staining-For Masson's trichrome staining, tissue cryosections were fixed with Bouin's solution overnight, rinsed with water, and incubated with Weigert's Hematoxylin staining reagent (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 5 min. Slides were washed with water for 10 min and stained with a commercially available kit (Sigma Aldrich). Briefly, slides were first stained with Biebrich Scarlet-Acid Fuchsin Solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 min, rinsed in three changes of water, followed by staining with phosphotungstic/phosphomolybdic acid solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min. Slides were then stained with aniline blue solution (Sigma Aldrich) for 5min to stain collagen in blue, differentiated with 1% glacial acetic acid for 2min, and then dehydrated with an ascending series of ethyl alcohol followed by xylene before they were mounted. Sections were imaged under the same conditions and intensities using a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope with an objective lens magnification at 20×. Analysis of fibrotic area was conducted in Fiji software, using color deconvolution and thresholding function to define the areas of collagen and the muscle fiber. The fibrotic area percentage is calculated as (collagen area/muscle fiber area) × 100.</p><p>Telomere length analysis of FACS isolated MuSCs (MuQ-FISH)-Telomere length was measured using quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization of Cy3-conjugated PNA telomere probe (Tel-C, PNA probe). MuSCs were isolated and processed for telomere length measurements as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Tichy et al., 2017)</ref>. MuSCs were imaged using a Nikon eclipse 90i wide-field epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Prior Proscan III motorized stage, a Photometrics Coolsnap HQ2 14-bit digital camera and a Nikon 100x/1.40 Plan Apo VC objective. Initially, control samples are imaged to determine each channel's exposure time in a way that situates the intensities for all samples in the mid-intensity range. This control prevents overexposure or loss of signal detection with the selected exposure times during sample imaging. Once an optimal exposure time is defined, image acquisition is utilized at the same exposure settings for the telomere and DAPI or centromeric signals for imaging of individual experiments. For each experiment, the intensity settings are not changed between sample groups. Images are taken without binning. Imaging must take place in the same time window for each experiment, and combination of multiple experiments performed at different days is not recommended, due to the inherent caveat of fluorescent intensity measurements differing between experiments. Telomere length was assessed as the total sum or mean telomeric probe intensity divided by the sum intensity of either the DAPI or the centromeric signal. Unbiased analysis with the investigators blinded to genotypes and/or conditions was conducted using the ImageJ plug-in Telometer.</p><p>Telomere length analysis of tissues sections-PFA-fixed cryosections were permeabilized for 10min with 0.5% Triton X-100, washed with PBS, and underwent heatmediated antigen retrieval with TET buffer (10mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.05% Tween-20). Sections were incubated with Tel C-Alexa Fluor 647 and CENPB-Cy3 (PNA bio, 1/600) in QFISH cryo-buffer (15% ethylene carbonate, 20% dextran sulfate, 600mM NaCl, 0.1% citric acid-based antigen retrieval buffer). Probe in buffer was added to slides, covered with a coverslip, and QFISH was carried out using a Thermobrite programmable slide warmer (Leica): 10min prehybridization step at 67°C, followed by 90min hybridization at 42C. Afterward, slides were washed twice, 5min each in buffers with decreasing salt concentrations at 55°C (2X SSC/0.1% Tween 20, 1X SSC/0.1% Tween 20, 0.5X SSC/0.1% Tween 20, 0.25X SSC/0.1% Tween 20). Slides were rinsed with PBS, blocked with 1% BSA/0.1% Triton X-100/1X PBS for 1hr at room temperature. Antibody to VCAM (ThermoFisher, 1/100) was added to the blocking buffer and slides were incubated overnight at 4°C. The following day, slides were washed with PBS and stained with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (ThermoFisher) in blocking buffer for 1hr at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS and coverslips were mounted with Prolong gold plus DAPI. Cryosections were imaged with a Nikon Ni widefield epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 100x Plan Apo objective and Nikon elements software. Analysis of telomere length was assessed with the investigators blinded to genotypes and/or conditions in VCAM + cells using Telometer. At least 40 cells per mouse were analyzed.</p><p>MuSC proliferation assays-Mice were injected with EdU (100mg/kg) IP, following the experimental design shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. MuSCs were plated overnight following sorting on laminin-coated 8-well chamber slides (~2500 cells) in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 15% FBS, 1X antibiotic/antimycotic, 1X Glutamax, 1X NEAA. Cells were fixed the following day in 3.7% formaldehyde/PBS for 15min and processed for EdU incorporation using the Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 594 Imaging kit (ThermoFisher), according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Grip test-Mice were inverted on a cross-hatched metal platform and the time required for mice to release themselves from the platform was quantified. Three repetition measurements were recorded per mouse, giving the mouse 1hr rest in between measurements.</p><p>Creatine kinase assay-Blood was collected from mice by cardiac puncture and allowed to clot. After centrifugation for 10min at 600 ×g, serum was diluted 1/10 with PBS and assayed and analyzed using a commercially available kit (Sekisui Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>Quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR)-RNA was isolated from FACS-sorted MuSCs using a RNeasy Plus micro kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was generated with the Protoscript II First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (New England Biolabs). qRT-PCR was carried out on a Quantstudio 6 instrument (Applied Biosystems) using Taqman primers and Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix. Reactions were carried out in triplicate with at least three mice analyzed per experiment. Gene expression was determined using the ΔΔCt method. Primers purchased from Applied Biosystems and included IKBKB-FAM (Gene assay ID: Mm01222247_m1), CHUK-FAM (Mm00432529_m1), IKBKG-FAM (Mm00494927_m1), XRCC5-FAM (Mm00550142_m1), XRCC6-FAM (Mm00487458_m1), TERF2-FAM (Mm01253555_m1), TERF1-FAM (Mm00436928_m1), TERF2IP-FAM (Mm01243676_m1), TPP1-FAM (Mm00487016_m1), TINF2-FAM (Mm00461166_g1), Pot1B-FAM (Mm01278790_m1), Tert-FAM (Mm00436931_m1), and GAPDH-VIC (4352339e).</p><p>In silico analysis of putative p65 binding sites in promoters-The potential of the p65 transcription factor to bind to selected murine gene promoters was analyzed using the Lasagna tool (<ref type="url" target="https://biogrid.engr.uconn.edu/lasagna_search/">https://biogrid.engr.uconn.edu/lasagna_search/</ref>) with the following conditions: using the transfac model, search range of -2000 to 0, p less than or equal to 0.001. Displayed are the Telomere-induced foci (TIF) assay-For chronic injury assessment, mice were injured in the Tibialis Anterior muscle with 10uL of 10ug/mL notexin weekly, for three times and harvested 3 days after the last injury. For dystrophic models, mice were injured once and harvested 3 days post-injury. 10 μm cryosections were stained as described in "telomere length analysis in tissue sections" above using a Tel-C Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated probe (PNA bio). After staining and processing, slides were blocked for 2 hours at room temperature with 3% BSA in PBS, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C with antibody to VCAM (1/100 of 1 μg/μL stock ThermoFisher) and 53BP1 (1/2000, Novus Biologicals). Slides were rinsed in PBS and incubated with donkey anti-goat Alexa fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (1/300) for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS three times before mounting coverslips with prolong gold with DAPI. For imaging, 1 μm slices were captured with a Zeiss Confocal 710 microscope with Zen software. TIFs were defined as 53BP1 foci overlapping or contacting telomere foci. For TIF assessment of human-derived MuSCs, cells were plated on collagen-coated chamber slides and stained with TelC-Alexa 647 PNA probe (according to Telomere Length Analysis of FACS Isolated MuSCs (MuQ-FISH) above). Slides were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 hour and stained with 53BP1 antibody (1/2000) overnight at 4°C, followed by staining with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted with fluoromount G with DAPI (Southern Biotech). Cells were imaged on a Nikon widefield epifluorescence microscope and quantitated for TIFs.</p><p>In-cell western-Human-derived MuSCs were plated in collagen-coated 96-well optical bottom plates in equal numbers, fixed in 4% PFA/PBS, permeabilized with 1% IGEPAL CA-630, blocked in 10% goat serum/1% BSA/PBS and stained with antibody against phospho-p65 serine 536 (1/100; Abcam) overnight at 4°C. Cells were washed with PBS and stained with Dylight 800 goat anti-rabbit (1/1,000; Rockland) and DNA was stained with DRAQ5 (1/5,000; Biolegend). Signal intensities were measured on an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System, with Image Studio software. Antibody intensity to nuclear intensity ratios were analyzed to normalize for cell content/growth differences.</p><p>Imaging using two-photon microscopy-To define MuSC number in their endogenous environment, Control (Pax7EGFP) and genetically modified mice bred to Pax7EGFP mice were injured 3X with notexin, starting around 3 months of age, and allowed to recover for ~10 weeks. TA muscles were collected, fixed in 4% PFA/PBS and rinsed in PBS. Muscles were mounted on a custom-made chamber and high-resolution serial sections were collected from the middle of the muscle, using a Leica SP* Confocal/Multiphoton Microscope system equipped with a Chameleon Vision II Sapphire laser. A 910 nm laser was focused through a 20x HCX APO L Lens. Emission light was collected with a FITC (BP 525/50) filter, and muscle fibers were marked via second-generation harmonics. Serial optical sections were collected every 1.5 μm, flattened, and normalized to volume scanned.</p><p>uCT imaging-Each mouse was scanned in vivo using a preclinical μCT system (vivaCT 40, Scanco Medical AG, Brüttisellen, Switzerland) at 38μm nominal voxel size. The scanner was used at 55kVp energy and 145μA intensity. Images were generated with an integration time of 200ms and 1 signal average. During the scans, mice were anesthetized using 1%-1.5% isoflurane in 1-1.5mL/min of oxygen. The mouse was immobilized using a customized holder to ensure minimal motion. Before each scan, a 2D scout view was used to select the scan region. The average scan time was approximately 50min.</p><p>Myoblast culture and shRNA knockdown-C2C12 myoblast cells were grown in DMEM high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1X antibiotic/antimycotic, 1X Glutamax, and 1X nonessential amino acids. Equal numbers of cells were plated at low density (3×10 4 cells/well) into 24 well plates and transfected with shRNA vectors using lipofectamine 3000, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Vectors used were shEMPTY (pLKO1.puro empty; Addgene plasmid 8453), mouse XRCC5-1 (Sigma SHCLNG-NM_009533; TRCN000031295), mouse XRCC5-2 (Sigma SHCLNG-NM_009533; TRCN0000071044). Transfected cells were re-plated in 8 well chamber slides 24 hours post-transfection, cultured a further 24 hours, and either subjected to MuQ-FISH or stained with antibody to Ku80 (Santa Cruz, B4, Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated) and imaged. Data were generated from 3 independently transfected wells which were stained, imaged and analyzed at the same end points. Analysis of nuclear Ku80 expression was determined using a semi-automated protocol in ImageJ.</p></div>
