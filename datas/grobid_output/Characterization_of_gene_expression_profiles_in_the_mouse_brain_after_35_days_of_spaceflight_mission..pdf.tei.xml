<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It has been proposed that neuroinflammatory response plays an important role in the neurovascular remodeling in the brain after stress. The goal of the present study was to characterize changes in the gene expression profiles associated with neuroinflammation, neuronal function, metabolism and stress in mouse brain tissue. Ten-week old male C57BL/6 mice were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) on SpaceX-12 for a 35-day mission. Within 38 ± 4 h of splashdown, mice were returned to Earth alive. Brain tissues were collected for analysis. A novel digital color-coded barcode counting technology (NanoString TM ) was used to evaluate gene expression profiles in the spaceflight mouse brain. A set of 54 differently expressed genes (p &lt; 0.05) significantly segregates the habitat ground control (GC) group from flight (FLT) group. Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were significantly altered by flight conditions. A decrease in the expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Moreover, mRNA expression of many genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were significantly downregulated. Here we report that significantly altered immune reactions may be closely associated with spaceflight-induced stress responses and have an impact on the neuronal function.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The spaceflight environment is characterized mainly by ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, microgravity, and physiological/psychological stressors. These conditions present a significant hazard to spaceflight crews during the course of mission activities. The susceptibility of the central nervous system (CNS) to spaceflightinduced changes can be particularly devastating to the health, mission performance, and quality of life of the spaceflight crew both acutely and chronically. The health risk from spaceflightinduced neuronal damage and potential adverse neurovascular effects are a chief concern, examples are intracranial fluid redistribution results in alteration of brain perfusion, neurovestibular problems, and cognitive alterations in astronauts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> caused by microgravity and/or strong gravitational changes during ascent and re-entry. Long-duration spaceflights reportedly induce immune dysregulation, which is considered a risk to astronaut safety and mission success <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Studies to date have demonstrated the altered distribution of peripheral leukocytes, a diminished function of specific leukocyte subpopulations, and skewed cytokine profiles in many astronauts <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . Many biomarkers associated with neuroinflammation following space radiation and space stressors in rodents and humans have been identified <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> . However, the precise nature of immune dysregulation during spaceflight is not well understood. Evidence suggests that acute exposure to galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) induce detrimental CNS changes including an increased level of neuroinflammation, neuronal damage and cognitive deficits similar to accelerated aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> . Ionizing radiation has been shown to elicit neuroinflammation through direct activation of microglia cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> and through the increased infiltration of immune and inflammatory cells through the damaged blood-brain barrier (BBB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . Study also showed that both microgravity encountered by astronauts in space and simulated microgravity on earth induce changes in brain structure and function <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . Microgravity induces a tremendous shift in body fluids, an increase in brain fluid and alterations in tissue perfusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> . Space microgravity modulates the expression of cellular molecules, and alters pro-inflammation cytokine secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Neuroinflammation is also a central pathological feature of several acute and chronic brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</p><p>The CNS is sensitive to oxidative injury due to its high oxygen consumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> , the content of oxidizable unsaturated lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> and low levels of anti-oxidant defenses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . Oxidative injury has been implicated as a causative or contributory factor in a number of neurodegenerative conditions, including aging, and ischemic, traumatic damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> . Our preliminary studies have shown that spaceflight and ionizing radiation cause prolonged oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction that may lead to chronic inflammation and adverse remodeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> . However, our knowledge about the mechanism and consequences of spaceflight condition-induced neuroinflammation is very limited. Because of the complexity of the processes and pathways that lead to neuroinflammation, an in-depth "omics" approach will potentially provide insight to understanding the impact of environmental insults on the CNS and the immune function that may have a long-lasting impact.</p><p>The goal of this study was to characterize changes in gene expression using a neuroinflammatory assay panel to investigate inflammation, neuronal function, growth, metabolism, and stress in mouse brain tissue after spaceflight.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes of gene expression in neuroinflammation panel</head><p>A set of 54 differently expressed genes (DEG) significantly (p &lt; 0.05) by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's HSD (honestly significant difference) test segregates the ground control (GC) group from the flight (FLT) group (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Clusters of genes related to neuronal function, neuronal cell support, immune function, and cellular growth and stress were significantly altered and organized based on their protein's role. SIN3A (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  gene/?term=NM_001110350</ref>), SLC2A5 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_019741">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g  ov/gene/?term=NM_019741</ref>), MERTK (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008587">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.  gov/gene/?term=NM_008587</ref>), TREM2 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_025864">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.  gov/gene/?term=NM_025864</ref>), RIPK1 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009068">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g  ov/gene/?term=NM_009068</ref>) are listed in multiple tables as they are found to play various roles.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Changes of gene expression associated with neuronal function</head><p>Genes directly involved with neuronal function were universally downregulated and are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Overall, a picture of decreased neuron plasticity and signaling dysfunction is painted. Those genes that are involved in neuron support cell function were also found to be broadly downregulated and are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. Microglial cell and oligodendrocyte dysfunction were most pronounced along with the inhibition of myelin sheath maintenance. Levels of immune and inflammation related gene expression were grossly downregulated except for two upregulated genes, H2-T23 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?  term=NM_010398</ref>) and SOX4 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?  term=NM_009238</ref>). The summary is presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Generally, we see the impairment of genes related to microbial defense with generalized dysfunction of immunity and disinhibition of inappropriate inflammation. And finally, genes with roles in cellular stress and growth are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref> with downregulation in all genes with exception of HSPB1 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_013560">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  gene/?term=NM_013560</ref>), GADD45G (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih  .gov/gene/?term=NM_011817</ref>), CCNG2 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635">https://www.ncbi.nlm.n  ih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635</ref>), SESN1 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001013370">https://www.ncbi.nlm.  nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001013370</ref>), and CDC25A (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007658">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007658</ref>) which were significantly upregulated. In general, we see an increased cellular stress response, growth arrest, and a possible trend toward more inflammatory-associated cell death.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spaceflight-induced changes of pathways</head><p>Many pathways associated with cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism were altered by flight condition using DEG identified by Nanostring's Advanced Analysis module pathway scoring through correlation-guided gene subsetting, which functionally annotated groups of genes followed by unsupervised clustering of samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . Higher scores compared to normalized gene expression general means upregulation while lower scores represent downregulation. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> summarized pathway results in a plot of all pathway scores compared to GC controls. Among these pathways, scores for angiogenesis, cytokine signaling, epigenetic regulation, and notch signaling were significantly increased which may indicate upregulation of the pathway (p &lt; 0.05), while scores for innate immune response and oligodendrocyte function were greatly reduced in the flight group compared to the controls which may indicate downregulation of the pathways (p &lt; 0.05) by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a-f</ref>). The score for microglia function was also decreased but with trending significance (p = 0.07) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6g</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Our data showed robust changes in gene expression profiles after spaceflight. Genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated. Decreased expression of genes important for oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance was observed. Downregulation of microglial gene expression that is important for apoptotic cell clearance, phagocytosis, and proliferation were evident. Genes supporting innate immune responses were also downregulated regarding antiviral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response. Expression of genes that are correlated with DNA damage and cellular stress were upregulated. Many of these observed changes are in line with our previous findings in the brains exposed to simulated spaceflight condition. Following combined exposure of simulated microgravity and radiation, pathways involved in neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, neuronal structure, stress, and cellular signaling are significantly altered <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . Gene expression in the brain that was analyzed after 90 days of simulated microgravity showed many genes related to catalytic and oxidoreductase activities were downregulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . However, in contrary to our findings, many genes related to stress, immune response, metabolic process, and/or inflammatory response were significantly upregulated in their study. Duration of environmental stress may play a role in different response of gene expression profiles and pathway regulation.</p><p>We saw uniform downregulation of gene expression in our mouse brain samples directly related to neuron function. NRGN (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029</ref>) coding for a postsynaptic kinase called neurogranin was found to be significantly reduced in expression. When neurogranin binds calmodulin, the concentration of calcium needed to transduce a signal is increased <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . Given the downregulation of NRGN (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_022029</ref>) and possible decrease in availability of neurogranin, neurons may become more sensitive to firing. KCND1(<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008423">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  gene/?term=NM_008423</ref>) codes for a potassium voltage-gated channel involved in neurotransmitter release which has been shown to be inhibited by some types of ROS generating treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> . Environmental stressor-induced ROS may be provoking the down regulation of KCND1(<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008423">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008423</ref>). DLG4 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001109752">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001109752</ref>) is transcribed into a protein associated with glutamatergic receptor signaling while also potentially participating in dendritogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . Its downregulation observed in our assay has the potential to affect glutamatergic neuron signaling, and affect dendritic morphology leading to further dysfunction. NLGN2 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_198862">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_198862</ref>) codes for a molecule which selectively mediates inhibitory synapses <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> . Its downregulation may contribute to dysfunction at inhibitory neuron synapses. Previous study has shown that inflammation induced loss of inhibitory nerve terminals or a redistribution of presynaptic machinery in inhibitory neurons may increase risk for developing neurological disease and psychiatric illness, including seizures and schizophrenia <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> .</p><p>Regarding genes involved in neuron function and plasticity, we continue to see universal downregulation in the flight tissue compared to GC controls. The gene SIN3A (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350</ref>) behaves as a transcriptional repressor involved in cortical neuron differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . In past studies the silencing of this gene in mice has shown decreased memory consolidation <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . It is possible that downregulation may have similar, albeit reduced effects on mice in spaceflight. RELN (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011261">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=  NM_011261</ref>) codes for an extracellular matrix serine protease that regulates microtubule function and plays a role in the layering of neurons in the cerebral cortex, among other structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> . Its enzymatic activity that is important for cell adhesion and reduced transcription, as seen in our flight mice, could lead to further reduction of nervous system plasticity.

The downregulation of this gene suggests the decreased ability of cells to utilize fructose as a potential energy source.</p><p>Level of gene expression related to neuron support cells, like microglial cells and oligodendrocytes were also seen universally downregulated. Microglia are the resident phagocytes of the innate immune system in the brain and play an important role in cytokine production <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> . Their activation is closely associated with environmental stress and microglial dysfunction is implicated in many neurological disorders and diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> . CSF1R (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001037859">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?  term=NM_001037859</ref>) is a gene coding for a cell-surface receptor which binds to colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113529">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113529</ref>) and interleukin-34 (IL-34) (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001135100">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_0011  35100</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> . CSF1R null mice have been shown to have fewer phagocytic cells and reduced survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref> . Given these findings we suggest that flight mice may have a reduced capacity to generate microglial cells in the nervous system. MERTK (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_008587">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?  term=NM_008587</ref>) creates a kinase protein in innate immune cells which mediates engulfment of apoptotic cells and acts as a negative regulator of inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> . Downregulation of this gene may contribute to immune dysregulation in our flight mice. TREM2 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_031254">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_031254</ref>) codes for a regulator of microglial chemotaxis and phagocytosis of apoptotic <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> . In previous in vivo studies with microglial lacking TREM2, decreased migration to areas of apoptotic neurons was shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> . NCF1 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001286037">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001286037</ref>) codes for a key subunit of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> . Downregulation suggests a reduced capacity for microglial cells to generate an effective microbial defense. SLC2A5 codes for the GLUT5 fructose transporter, as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . With reduced activity, microglial cells may have less capacity to utilize fructose as an energy source and may be more prone to suffer from metabolic related dysfunction.</p><p>Oligodendrocytes are the myelin-forming cells of the CNS. It plays critical roles in axonal metabolic support, myelination, and providing nutritional support to neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> . A couple of key genes involved in the oligodendrocyte function have been significantly downregulated in the flight mice. PLP1 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011123">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011123</ref>) codes for a major myelin protein that plays an important role in its formation and maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> . The implication of significantly downregulated PLP1 indicates impaired neuron axonal function with the possibility of long-term neurodegeneration. OPALIN (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_153520">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_153520</ref>) plays a role in oligodendrocyte cytoskeletal remolding and morphology. Downregulation of this gene observed in our study may be an indication of decreased activity of oligodendrocytes. These findings are further reinforced by a significantly decreased oligodendrocyte function pathway score (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>).</p><p>In terms of gene expression that associated with general immune functions and inflammation, only two genes were found to be significantly upregulated in our flight mice population, H2-T23 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010398</ref>) and SOX4 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009238</ref>). H2-T23 expression is essential for immunological protection and regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> . HT-T23 dependent T-cell inhibitory interactions aid in preventing expansion of autoreactive CD4 T-cells and collateral autoimmune diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> . Upregulation of this gene may be a protective response to generalized inflammation in the flight mice. SOX4 directly regulates Innate-like γδ T-cell (Tγδ17), a major source of interleukin-17 (IL-17) (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010552">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  gene/?term=NM_010552</ref>). Increased SOX4 expression may lead to an increase of this cytokine expression in the flight mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> .</p><p>The gene RIPK1 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009068">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM  _009068</ref>) has been shown to be a promotor of survival, apoptotic and inflammatory signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64</ref> . However, mice deficient in RIPK1 demonstrated loss of inhibition of a necroptosis pathway which promoted the release of necroptotic damageassociated molecular patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65</ref> . Downregulation of RIPK1 observed in our study may lead to a similar reduction of appropriate apoptosis and an increase in necroptosis resulting in undesirable inflammation. Overall, taking these findings in conjunction with a significantly increased cytokine signaling pathway score (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>), inflammatory signaling appears to be significantly dysregulated in our spaceflight mice.</p><p>Immune dysfunction is further illustrated via the downregulation of two genes important for antimicrobial defense. MPEG1 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010821">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010821</ref>) is a pore-forming bactericidal molecule of the innate immune system. It has been shown to be required for the activity of ROS and nitric oxide and their antibacterial effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67</ref> . OPTN (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_181848">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  gene/?term=NM_181848</ref>) codes for a protein that plays a key role in bacterial autophagic clearance. Deficient mice have also been  shown to have impaired interferon regulatory factors (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001159393">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001159393</ref>) signaling and reduced response to toll-like receptor stimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68</ref> . In summary, these results imply the impaired antibacterial capabilities and increased viral susceptibility in the flight mouse brain compared to GC group.</p><p>Our data indicate that the regulation of innate immune response was impaired following spaceflight. The pathway score for the innate immune response was significantly reduced in the flight group compared to GCs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6c</ref>). The cell type score for exhausted CD8 cells is also greatly reduced for the flight group compared to controls and may indicate a dysfunctional phenotype in CD8 T-cell response. T-cell exhaustion represents an adaptive response to conditions of chronic antigen stimulation and inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69</ref> , as well as promoting tissue repair following an inflammatory injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">70</ref> . Functionally exhausted CD8+ cells may result in a severely compromised innate immune response <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71</ref> .</p><p>Cytochrome P450 27A1 (CYP27A1) (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_024264">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  gene/?term=NM_024264</ref>) plays an important role in the metabolism of cholesterol and cholesterol-related compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72</ref> . In humans, complete CYP27A1 deficiency leads to nodule formation in the brain which may lead to dementia, cerebellar ataxia, and spinal cord paresis <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> . This altered cholesterol metabolism closely associates with inflammatory responses involved in the pathogenesis of AD progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> . In deficient mice, a significant increase in cholestanol in the brain is observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">75</ref> . Downregulation of CYP27A1, as seen in our flight mice, may lead to neurodegeneration and inflammation in more chronic settings or to a milder degree.</p><p>Fourteen genes that were significantly altered in the flight mice compared to GCs were found to have direct roles in cellular growth, proliferation, and stress response. Two upregulated genes play an important part in cell cycle arrest during times of cellular stress. GADD45G (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_011817</ref>) has been found to play a role in activating checkpoints in the cell cycle following exposure of cells to irradiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76</ref> . CCNG2 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007635</ref>) contributes to cell cycle arrest during DNA damage and is upregulated in response to diverse stimuli, including hypoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77</ref> . Additionally, expression of CCNG2 is found to be significantly increased in cell cycle-arrested and terminally differentiated cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">78</ref> . Upregulation of these genes may be due to exposure to irradiation, among other stressors, during spaceflight.</p><p>The downregulation of genes involved in promoting transcription and cell cycle progression was also seen. BRD2 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010238">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_010238</ref>) codes for a nuclear kinase involved in regulating the expression of cell cycle genes via binding to multiple E2Fs, a family of transcription factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">79</ref> . E2F1 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_007891">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_  007891</ref>) regulates activation of DNA replication and G1/S transition when interacting with BRD2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">80</ref> . BRD2 also interacts with BRD3, a chromatin reader with roles in regulating transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">81</ref> . BRD3 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113573">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001113573</ref> ) further regulates transcription by promoting the binding of the transcription factors to their targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">82</ref> . SIN3A (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001110350</ref>) codes for a transcription factor which regulates cell cycle progression by repressing gene expression for cell cycle inhibitor <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . It has been linked to functional cellular changes in proliferation, cell cycle, and stem cell function in mice models <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">83</ref> . Downregulation of these genes involved in the promotion of cellular proliferation may further amplify the upregulation of genes with roles in cell cycle arrest. These changes are similarly reinforced by a significantly increased epigenetic regulation pathway score (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6e</ref>) indicating that there may be an increased level of modulating and checks being implemented during transcription, due to spaceflight. A recent study has shown that cell cycle regulation is closely linked to hippocampal neurogenesis which plays critical roles in memory and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84</ref> . Neurogenesis is a dynamic process that involves proliferation and differentiation of stem and progenitor cells, or survival and maturation of newborn neurons <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">84</ref> . Environmental stressors have been shown to modulate cell cycle progression, particular in the G1 phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">85</ref> . These observed changes of gene expression related to the cell cycle in our study may indicate altered regulation of neurogenesis.</p><p>Many downregulated genes were known to be involved in cellular stress responses. MAP2K4 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_009157">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  gene/?term=NM_009157</ref>) is a kinase involved with responses to cellular stress including apoptosis, inflammation, cellular proliferation, and neurodegeneration. A deficiency of MAP2K4 has been shown to result in cellular susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86</ref> . However, it has been demonstrated that disruption of both MAP2K4 and MAP2K7 (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001042557">https://  www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_001042557</ref>) genes was     required to thoroughly block cellular growth caused by environmental stressors <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87</ref> . MRE11A (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=NM_018736">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?  term=NM_018736</ref>), a part of an exonuclease complex central to the cellular DNA damage response was downregulated. The MRE11 complex is essential to vertebrates and defects lead to sensitivity to DNA damage and cell cycle checkpoints deficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88</ref> . Its downregulation may point to a certain level of dysfunction leading to an impaired response to cellular stress leaving the flight mice more vulnerable to DNA damage. Different brain regions have different vulnerability to environmental stressors due to structural and biological heterogeneity of the regions, cell types and molecular networks 89 . Regional differences of protein biomarkers in response to stressors were observed in a previous flight study <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . Given this finding, gene expression profiles in specific regions of the brain in response to spaceflight will be investigated in future studies. More recently, single-cell sequencing technologies, including transcriptomics, are available by directly measuring multiple molecular signatures in specific brain cells, providing robust molecular identity of specific cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90</ref> .</p><p>Brain tissues were dissected and prepared for analysis within 60 h after landing. It is possible that observed changes in gene expression profiles in neuroinflammation are a compensatory acute response to the acceleration and intense noise of launch or reflect changes to the combined response of spaceflight environment and the landing.  In order to evaluate the immune response to spaceflight environment, in the further study, mice will be euthanized in the orbit and brain tissues will be immediately preserved for analysis on the ground. Furthermore, in order to test the hypothesis that neuroinflammation plays an important role in developing spaceflightinduced stress response in the brain, an anti-oxidant or antiinflammatory compound will be injected to mouse before or during the flight to determine the protective effect against oxidative damage in the brain.</p><p>It is noted from our study that among those genes which expression were significantly altered by spaceflight, markedly more gene expressions are being downregulated than upregulated. It is speculated that many genes may be upregulated during spaceflight and the early phase after landing as an adaptation response. During re-adaptation, the expression of these previous upregulated genes could be then downregulated as a compensatory response, or when protein synthesis from upregulated genes has been completed, these genes expression may be downregulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> .</p><p>Collectively, changes noted in our study indicate that exposure to the spaceflight environment induces significant changes in gene expression and signaling pathways related to neuronal function, immune regulation, growth and metabolic function. Study showed that chronically dysfunctional and deregulated pathways, including cytokine signaling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>), epigenetic regulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6e</ref>), and notch signaling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6f</ref>) play important roles in disease development <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91</ref> , and have been associated with several progressive neurodegenerative diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92</ref> . Our observed changes of a dysregulated inflammatory response, downregulated T-cell response, and reduced microglia signaling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6g</ref>) might also have an impact on brain structure and function, and further lead to chronic neuroinflammation. It has been shown that here are strong correlations between neuroinflammatory biomarkers, brain morphology and behavioral outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">93</ref> . It may be hypothesized that chronical changes of observed gene expression profiles could have long-term effects on brain morphology and organism behavior.</p></div>

All FLT mice were maintained at an ambient temperature of 26-28 °C with a 12-h light/dark cycle during the flight. Habitat GC mice were kept under similar housing conditions, including temperature, humidity and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) levels using 48-h delayed telemetry data from the FLT group. Water and food bar diet specifically designed by NASA were provided ad libitum to FLT and GC groups. All mice received the same access to food and water.

Data files generated from nCounter system were analyzed using nSolver 4.0 software with the Advanced Analysis module for QC (quality control), normalization, DE analysis, and gene-set enrichment analysis. Data normalization included 2 steps: Positive control normalization to correct platform-associated variation and Codeset content normalization using the housekeeping (HK) genes to correct variability of input samples. Geometric means of selected HK probes were used to normalize counts of the samples and DEGs were generated from the normalized counts.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>Gene expression profiling data were analyzed using nSolver analysis and the advanced analysis module software. Advanced analysis module software uses open-source R program for pathway scoring and gene-set enrichment analysis. Using the Reactome pathway database annotations, pathway scores are derived by calculating the first principle component of pathway genes' normalized expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86</ref> and data are summarized from changes of a gene set within a given pathway into a single score.</p><p>To further analyze the associated pathways of the DEGs, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis was performed using biological process database to identify the annotated sets of genes based on the biological processes in which they participate. Significantly differential expression genes were presented in the tables with individual genes using log 10 (p value) andlog 2 fold change compared to the GC group. Pathview module was used to display upregulated genes or downregulated genes overlaid on KEGG pathways. For DEG and pathway analysis, p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant between FLT and GC groups by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 Spaceflight-induced changes of gene expression related to neuronal function.
