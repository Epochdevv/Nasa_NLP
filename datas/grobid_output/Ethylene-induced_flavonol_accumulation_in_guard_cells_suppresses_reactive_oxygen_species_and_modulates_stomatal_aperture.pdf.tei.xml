<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Guard cell swelling controls the aperture of stomata, pores that facilitate gas exchange and water loss from leaves. The hormone abscisic acid (ABA) has a central role in regulation of stomatal closure through synthesis of second messengers, which include reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS accumulation must be minimized by antioxidants to keep concentrations from reaching damaging levels within the cell. Flavonols are plant metabolites that have been implicated as antioxidants; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated. Flavonols accumulate in guard cells of Arabidopsis thaliana, but not surrounding pavement cells, as visualized with a flavonolspecific dye. The expression of a reporter driven by the promoter of CHALCONE SYNTHASE, a gene encoding a flavonol biosynthetic enzyme, in guard cells, but not pavement cells, suggests guard cell-specific flavonoid synthesis. Increased levels of ROS were detected using a fluorescent ROS sensor in guard cells of transparent testa4-2, which has a null mutation in CHALCONE SYNTHASE and therefore synthesizes no flavonol antioxidants. Guard cells of transparent testa4-2 show more rapid ABA-induced closure than the wild type, suggesting that flavonols may dampen the ABA-dependent ROS burst that drives stomatal closing. The levels of flavonols are positively regulated in guard cells by ethylene treatment in the wild type, but not in the ethylene-insensitive2-5 mutant. In addition, in both ethylene-overproducing1 and ethylene-treated wild-type plants, elevated flavonols lead to decreasing ROS and slower ABA-mediated stomatal closure. These results are consistent with flavonols suppressing ROS accumulation and decreasing the rate of ABA-dependent stomatal closure, with ethylene-induced increases in guard cell flavonols modulating these responses.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flavonols and Their Biosynthetic Machinery Are Found in Guard Cells</head><p>To determine whether flavonols accumulate in guard cells, we used diphenylboric acid 2-aminoethyl ester (DPBA) dye to detect flavonols. The specificity of DPBA fluorescence was demonstrated in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) roots using mutants in flavonol synthesis, with no signal observed in the transparent testa4-2 (tt4-2) mutant that makes no flavonoids <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lewis et al., 2011)</ref> because of a mutation in the gene that encodes chalcone synthase (CHS), the first step in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. The DPBA fluorescence of the surface of an Arabidopsis leaf, with and without a differential interference contrast (DIC) overlay of pavement cells, illustrated localized accumulation of flavonols in guard cells with no signal in surrounding pavement cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, A and B). This pattern was observed in more than 50 leaves. We also asked whether the flavonol localization was restricted to guard cells as a result of flavonol biosynthesis in those cells. Epidermal leaf peels of transgenic plants with a CHS promoter driving a GUS reporter were visualized by bright-field microscopy. GUS product accumulated in the epidermal guard cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>), with no GUS product accumulation in surrounding pavement cells. This reporter is expressed in additional cell layers in cross sections of whole leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chory and Peto, 1990)</ref>. These results were consistent with tissue-specific signals, including transcriptional controls of flavonol synthesis, restricting flavonol accumulation to guard cells.</p><p>To more quantitatively and precisely image DPBA in leaf tissue, we optimized laser scanning confocal microscope (LSCM) settings in order to spectrally separate total flavonol fluorescence from chlorophyll autofluorescence. Using the basal surface of a whole Arabidopsis leaf, confocal micrographs showed autofluorescence of chlorophyll in the blue channel and DPBA staining in the yellow channel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The absence of the DPBA signal in tt4-2 guard cells confirmed the specificity of this staining in leaf tissues, complementing the previous studies in roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Buer and Muday, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lewis et al., 2011)</ref>. This image indicated that we can resolve these two fluorescent signals and that flavonols accumulated in the cytosol, but not the chloroplasts of guard cells. It was also evident that DPBA fluorescence was greater in the regions of the guard cell that appeared to be nuclei, a cellular location that exhibited flavonoid accumulation in other plant cells types <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Feucht et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Saslowsky et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lewis et al., 2011)</ref>. Verification of nuclear flavonol accumulation was completed by simultaneously imaging DPBA and Hoechst 33258, a nucleic acid stain (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). After imaging DPBA with spectral separation, we imaged the same guard cells using single-channel microscopy to visualize Hoechst fluorescence and consistently observed that the region of bright DPBA staining in the center of each guard cell also had nucleic acids, as detected by Hoechst, consistent with a nuclear accumulation of flavonols.</p><p>The levels of DPBA fluorescence in the cytosol and nucleus of the wild type and tt4-2 were quantified in 90 guard cells and are reported relative to the levels in the cytosol of ecotype Columbia 0 of Arabidopsis (Col-0; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). DPBA fluorescence was at background levels in tt4-2, whereas wild-type plants had a robust DPBA fluorescent signal, with approximately 2-fold higher intensity in the nucleus than in the cytosol.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flavonol Accumulation in Guard Cells Affects ABA-Induced Stomatal Closure</head><p>To analyze the functional significance of flavonol accumulation in guard cells, we compared ABA-dependent stomatal closure in wild-type and tt4-2 guard cells. Because ABA triggers a ROS burst in guard cells and flavonols reduce ROS concentrations, we expected flavonol concentrations in guard cells to be inversely proportional to the rates of ABA-induced stomatal closure. Leaves were excised and incubated with 20 mM ABA for 0, 45, 90, or 180 min. At the indicated times after treatment, epidermal peels were generated and DIC images were captured and used for measurement of stomatal aperture. Apertures were quantified in 30 stomata for three separate experiments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). Although tt4 and the wild type showed similar aperture in opening solution, the initial ABA-induced stomatal closure response was greater in tt4 guard cells than the control, with all aperture values significantly different than the wild type (P , 0.05). The apertures of stomata were also quantified in the absence of ABA under identical conditions over the same time course in these two genotypes. The guard cells remained open under these conditions and there were no detectable differences between the wild type and tt4-2 (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). We also examined the effect of 3 h of ABA treatment on DPBA fluorescence in guard cells, mirroring the time course of ABA in the stomatal closure assays to ask if ABA altered flavonol synthesis. The  DPBA signal was not altered by ABA during this 3-h treatment (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>). These results were consistent with the absence of an antioxidant in tt4-2 guard cells that leads to an increase in signaling via ROS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elevated Ethylene Levels through Exogenous Treatment or in the ethylene-overproducing1 Mutant Increase Flavonol Accumulation</head><p>Because elevated ethylene levels were previously shown to increase flavonol accumulation in Arabidopsis roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lewis et al., 2011)</ref>, we asked whether there is similar regulation in guard cells. DPBA fluorescence was examined in the ethylene-overproducing1 (eto1) mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Chae et al., 2003)</ref> and enhanced flavonol accumulation was observed in the guard cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). The DPBA fluorescence intensity was quantified in 90 stomata and average fluorescence is reported relative to the values in the cytosol of Col-0 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). There is a .1.6-fold increase in DPBA fluorescence in the cytosol and a .1.5-fold increase in the nuclei of eto1 guard cells compared with the wild type (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>; P , 0.001).</p><p>To further examine the effect of ethylene on flavonol synthesis in guard cells, we treated plants with exogenous ethylene. The wild type and the ethylene-insensitive2-5 (ein2-5) mutant, an ethylene signaling mutant with nearly complete ethylene insensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alonso et al., 1999)</ref>, were treated with 5 mL/L ethylene gas for 24 h, and then DPBA fluorescence in the guard cells was imaged (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). The DPBA fluorescence was quantified in both the nucleus and cytosol, as described above, for 30 stomata per treatment in three separate experiments, and the average signal relative to the signal in the cytosol of untreated Col-0 was calculated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>). Similar to eto1, the guard cells of ethylene-treated wild-type plants had enhanced DPBA fluorescence in the cytosol and nuclei compared with an untreated control (P , 0.01). A similar magnitude increase in DPBA fluorescence was also evident after 3 h of ethylene treatment, as shown in Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3A</ref>. Guard cells of ein2-5 had significantly lower DPBA fluorescence than Col-0 in both the cytosol and nucleus in the absence of treatment (P , 0.02) and showed no increase in DPBA fluorescence after ethylene treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref>).</p><p>We employed HPLC together with mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) to directly quantify concentrations of kaempferol and quercetin in whole leaves to examine the effect of elevated ethylene levels on flavonol concentration. Hydrolyzed flavonol samples extracted from 18 leaves of 4-week-old Col-0, tt4-2, and eto1 plants were analyzed to examine the total flavonol pools of each compound. The concentrations of flavonols were detected in three  separate experiments, with a representative graph shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>. Flavonol extractions from whole leaves showed 1.3-and 5-fold increased levels of accumulation of kaempferol and quercetin, respectively, in eto1 compared with the wild type. This experimental approach could not demonstrate that ethylene-dependent increases in flavonols were localized specifically to guard cells, but it did illustrate that the increases in total flavonol concentrations mirror the fluorescence increases in guard cells observed with DPBA staining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ROS Accumulate in Guard Cells and Are Affected by Flavonol Concentrations</head><p>The concentrations of ROS are highly regulated in guard cells and are an essential feature of rapid stomatal closure in response to ABA <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Pei et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kwak et al., 2003)</ref>. ROS concentration within guard cells was examined to determine whether flavonols are acting as antioxidants in vivo. To visualize ROS accumulation in Arabidopsis leaf tissue, we used 2',7' dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA), a general ROS fluorescent sensor <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Halliwell and Whiteman, 2004</ref>). In the past, this fluorescent probe has been imaged with UV light to visualize ROS in guard cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kwak et al., 2003)</ref>; however, we excited with a 488-nm laser, a wavelength that is more frequently used when imaging this probe <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Halliwell and Whiteman, 2004)</ref>. H2DCF-DA is taken up by cells, in which internal cellular esterases cleave off the diacetate functional group, preventing 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) from diffusing outside of the cell. Upon oxidation by ROS, DCF becomes fluorescent. To minimize any dye uptake difference or light-induced fluorescence increases that can occur with this dye <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Murata et al., 2001)</ref>, all incubation and imaging times and settings were carefully maintained within each experimental comparison.</p><p>We used spectral separation through confocal microscopy to separate out chlorophyll autofluorescence from DCF fluorescence in guard cells in epidermal leaf peels of the wild type, tt4-2, and eto1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). In all three genotypes, DCF fluorescence was at very low levels in pavement cells, but accumulated in guard cells in both nuclei and the cytosol, with greater fluorescence in the nuclei, mirroring the tissue and subcellular accumulation of flavonols. The levels of DCF fluorescence in the cytosol and nucleus of the wild type, tt4, and eto1 were quantified in 90 guard cells and values were normalized relative to the levels in the cytosol of Col-0 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>). In the tt4 mutant, which does not synthesize flavonols, DCF fluorescence intensity was greater in both the cytosol and the nucleus of guard cells compared with the wild type. Quantification of DCF fluorescence indicated that there is a 2-and 2.5-fold increase in tt4-2 in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively, compared with wild-type guard cells.</p><p>There were also lower levels of DCF fluorescence in eto1 than in the wild type with reduction to 60% of the values in the untreated wild type, consistent with the higher levels of antioxidants in the presence of elevated ethylene. Ethylene treatment for 24 h showed decreased ROS accumulation in the wild type (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), with similar ROS decreases observed after 3 h of ethylene treatment compared with untreated controls (Supplemental Fig, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2B</ref>). In tt4, there were increased levels of ROS detected at 24 h, but not after 3 h of ethylene treatment compared with untreated tt4 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). The 24-h ethylene treatment results mirrored a previous report that ethylene induced ROS accumulation in guard cells through activation of NADPH oxidase AtRBOHF <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desikan et al., 2006)</ref>. Together these images suggested an antioxidant activity of flavonols in guard cells, by illustrating an inverse relationship between flavonol concentration and ROS levels using both mutants to block flavonol synthesis and treatments and mutants to elevate ethylene levels and flavonol accumulation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stomatal Closure Is Modulated by Ethylene Levels</head><p>The effect of 24 h of ethylene treatment of the wild type and tt4 and in the untreated eto1 mutant was examined using the same above-described stomatal closure assay. The closure at time 0, 45, and 90 min after ABA treatment for 90 stomata from three experiments were quantified in these three genotypes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref>). After incubation in the opening solution for 3 h, all stomata were equivalently open and in the absence of added ABA, remained equivalently open (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). Ethylene-treated wild-type and eto1 guard cells showed decreased closure in response to ABA, whereas untreated tt4 shows the most stomatal closure at each time point. When wild-type plants were treated with ethylene for 3 h (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3C</ref>), similar results were observed. We expected that tt4 would show no response to ethylene treatment, if the only effect of ethylene is on flavonoid synthesis; however, we found that it does show a reduced stomatal closure in the presence of 24 h of ethylene treatment, but not 3 h. The stomatal aperture is still smaller in tt4-2 with ethylene treatment than in Col-0 with ethylene, consistent with a role for ethylene-mediated flavonol synthesis in reducing the rate of stomatal closure through modulation of ROS signals. The difference in stomatal aperture in tt4 in the absence and presence of 24 h of ethylene treatment suggests the presence of a separate flavonol-independent pathway by which ethylene treatment facilitates stomatal closure. The absence of this effect at 3 h suggests that this may well be a secondary effect of extended ethylene treatments.</p></div>

Number signs indicate significant differences (P , 0.05) between treated and untreated controls within a genotype as determined by the Student's t test. Bar = 15 mm.</p><p>We examined where and how flavonols accumulated in the epidermal layers of leaves in order to better understand their role in cell signaling. Flavonol accumulation was visualized through confocal microscopy, using a flavonol-specific fluorescent dye, DPBA. In the wild type, DPBA fluorescence was localized to guard cells but was absent in surrounding pavement cells, whereas it was not detected in any cell types in the flavonoiddeficient tt4-2 mutant. Localized flavonol accumulation in guard cells could be a result of localized synthesis or selective import of these molecules into the cells. To examine whether flavonol biosynthetic enzymes are synthesized in guard cells in planta, a CHS:GUS transgenic line was utilized. CHS promoter-driven GUS product accumulated specifically in guard cells and not in surrounding epidermal pavement cells, which suggests that production of CHS, a key flavonol biosynthesis enzyme, is localized to Arabidopsis guard cells. This result is consistent with previous research that shows the presence of transcripts encoding enzymes of flavonol biosynthesis in guard cell protoplasts, including chalcone isomerase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, flavonol synthase1, and flavonoid 39hydroxylase <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pandey et al., 2010)</ref>. This result extends previous study in two ways. First, it minimized the damage to cells that is the result of creating protoplasts, which may increase the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes in cells where they are not normally produced <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dixon and Paiva, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Winkel-Shirley, 2002)</ref>. Second, the available microarray data do not have a pavement cell transcriptome for comparison <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Pandey et al., 2010)</ref>. Using very different experimental methods in Vicia faba, flavonols were previously reported to accumulate in guard cells and surrounding epidermal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Schnabl et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Takahama, 1988)</ref>. Both reports used spectrophotometric imaging of epidermal peels, which limits the resolution of flavonols accumulation in individual cells. Using the highly localized accumulation of DPBA fluorescence, our results demonstrate that there is a guard cell-specific flavonol accumulation profile in Arabidopsis.</p><p>Because flavonols accumulate specifically in guard cells, we asked whether these molecules function as antioxidants to reduce ROS concentrations. Flavonols have been shown to have antioxidant activity in vitro; however, their antioxidant activity in planta has been debated <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rice-Evans et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hern√°ndez et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Pollastri and Tattini, 2011)</ref>. Because ROS has been implicated as a second messenger in guard cell signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(McAinsh et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Murata et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zhang et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kwak et al., 2003)</ref>, we asked whether the presence of flavonols affected the ROS accumulation in guard cells. To visualize ROS accumulation, we used DCFH-DA, a general ROS sensor, and utilized spectral separation to remove chlorophyll autofluorescence. DCF fluorescence was localized to guard cells, similar to the DPBA fluorescence pattern, indicating that both flavonols and ROS accumulate specifically in this cell type, but not in surrounding pavement cells. In addition, we saw increased DCF fluorescence in tt4-2 mutants that synthesize no flavonols, consistent with the absence of flavonols resulting in increased ROS concentrations, which is also consistent with an antioxidant activity for flavonols in vitro.</p><p>DPBA fluorescence were at higher levels in the nuclei than the cytosol in all genotypes and treatments. This observation is consistent with characteristics of other plant species that showed flavonoid and ROS accumulation in the nuclei <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Feucht et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Mazars et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lewis et al., 2011)</ref>. Immunolocalization with antibodies against CHS and chalcone isomerase suggests that the enzymes of flavonoid synthesis are localized to the nucleus in Arabidopsis roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Saslowsky et al., 2005)</ref>. The nuclear localization of flavonols is consistent with the notion that ROS can regulate gene expression through interaction with redox-sensitive transcription factors (TFs) in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Wu et al., 2012)</ref>, such as the wellestablished redox-sensitive TF described in bacteria and mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Aslund et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Biswas et al., 2006)</ref>. Flavonols are a likely candidate to modulate the activity of redox-sensitive TFs, because of their increased accumulation in the nuclei; however, it is unlikely that they are the only antioxidant present in this organelle. Flavonols have been shown to chelate metal ions, such as Fe 3+ , which catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals from H 2 O 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hern√°ndez et al., 2009)</ref>. Thus, flavonol accumulation in the nucleus would contribute to a decreased redox potential in the nucleus, potentially decreasing the number of TF oxidation events. Combined with our data suggesting an in planta antioxidant ability of flavonols, we hypothesize that flavonol accumulation in the nuclei may modulate the activity of redox-sensitive TFs that affect gene expression in addition to preventing oxidative damage to DNA, although the time scale of transcriptional effects may be beyond the rapid regulation of guard cell aperture.</p><p>Because stomatal apertures are environmentally regulated, we hypothesized that regulation of flavonol synthesis may be a way for plants to modulate the physiology of guard cells. Previous studies have shown that ethylene increases flavonol accumulation in Arabidopsis roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Buer et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lewis et al., 2011)</ref>, and we asked whether this hormone may also increase flavonol accumulation in guard cells. Elevated levels of ethylene through endogenous overproduction in the eto1 mutant and exogenous application of ethylene to wild-type leaves increased flavonol accumulation in this cell type, as visualized by localized DPBA fluorescence. We observed robust increases in DPBA fluorescence at both 3 and 24 h after treatment with ethylene gas. This ethyleneenhanced flavonol accumulation pattern requires a functional ethylene signaling pathway, because the ethylene-induced DPBA fluorescence increases were lost in the ein2 mutant. A previous study showed that ethylene-induced flavonoid increases detected by DPBA can also be detected by LC-MS <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lewis et al., 2011)</ref>. We therefore verified these flavonols increases in leaves using LC-MS and detected approximately 5-fold increases in quercetin and a smaller, but still statistically significant, increase in kaempferol in whole leaves treated with ethylene under similar conditions.</p><p>We also observed decreased DCF fluorescence in the wild type and tt4 treated with ethylene for 3 or 24 h as well as in eto1 guard cells compared with the wild type, suggesting that the increase in flavonols decreases ROS concentrations. In addition, ethylene-treated wild-type guard cells and eto1 exhibited a decreased rate of ABAinduced stomatal closure, a result that is consistent with flavonols acting as antioxidants reducing the H 2 O 2 burst that drives stomatal closure.</p><p>Ethylene has been shown to promote both stomatal closure in Arachis hypogaea and Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Pallas and Kays, 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Desikan et al., 2006)</ref> and stomatal opening in Dianthus caryophyllus, Solanum lycopersicum, V. faba, and Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Madhavan et al., 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Levitt et al., 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tanaka et al., 2005)</ref>. Applied ethylene gas or its precursor, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, was shown to induce stomatal closure through elevated ROS production generated by AtRBOHF, an NADPH oxidase <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desikan et al., 2006)</ref>. In our study, a previously reported ROS burst that was observed upon ethylene treatment of wildtype guard cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Desikan et al., 2006)</ref> was masked by increased flavonol accumulation, but we observed that a 24-h ethylene treatment of tt4 led to elevated ROS (although this increase was not detected after 3 h of treatment), consistent with the absence of antioxidants. Other researchers report that treatment of wild-type plants with ethylene or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid or endogenous ethylene overproduction in eto1 inhibit stomatal closure in the presence of ABA in Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Tanaka et al., 2005)</ref> and in wheat (Triticum durum; <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chen et al., 2013)</ref>. These findings are mirrored in our results, with decreased ROS and stomatal closure in response to ethylene treatment or the eto1 mutation. We predicted that ethylene-treated tt4 might be insensitive to the effect of ethylene on stomatal aperture, because there will be no change in flavonoid antioxidants. We found that in both the wild type and tt4, ethylene reduced the rate of stomatal closure, consistent with a flavonoidand ROSindependent ethylene regulation of this process, although the tt4 mutant has a greater rate in both cases consistent with a second ROS-dependent mechanism. A ROS-independent pathway for ABA-induced stomatal closure was previously suggested <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kwak et al., 2003)</ref>. ABA treatment of atrbohD/F double mutant guard cells resulted in no change in ROS concentrations, although cytosolic Ca 2+ elevations were observed in nearly one-half of all guard cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kwak et al., 2003)</ref>. We hypothesize that a 24-h ethylene treatment may inhibit ROS-independent stomatal closure in the absence of flavonols, which would explain the delayed closure that is observed in ethylene-treated tt4. Our results suggest that ethylene induces flavonol accumulation, which reduces both the concentration of ROS and the rate of ABA-induced stomatal closure.</p><p>We have constructed a model to synthesize these data, which is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>. This model outlines the ABA signaling pathway in which ABA activates respiratory burst oxidases increasing the levels of ROS, which act as signaling molecules to induce stomatal closure. Flavonoids act as antioxidants reducing the levels of ROS, which decrease the rate of stomatal closure. Elevated levels of ethylene, both through elevated synthesis in eto1 or by treatment with exogenous ethylene, increase flavonol accumulation and decrease ROS, resulting in a reduced rate of stomatal closure. When a flavonoiddeficient mutant is treated with ethylene, we find that ROS levels increase after 24 h of treatment, but not after 3 h of treatment. These findings suggest that extended ethylene elevated ROS accumulation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, dotted line), but that the elevated ethylene after ROS treatment in the wild type more than compensates by increasing levels of flavonol antioxidants. We predicted that tt4 would be insensitive to the effect of ethylene on stomatal closure, whereas we found that this treatment leads to a reduced rate of closure, which is evident at 24 h, but not 3 h of ethylene treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, dotted line). We hypothesize that ethylene may enhance the synthesis of a second signaling molecule that may act to alter stomatal closure through a separate mechanism in the presence of extended ethylene treatment. Yet the absence of ethylene effects on ROS and stomatal aperture after 3-h treatments suggests that the primary effects of ethylene are on synthesis of flavonol antioxidants that suppress ROS levels.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSION</head><p>Guard cell function is integral to plant adaptation to a changing environment. Much is known about the role of ROS as a second messenger in this cell type <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Wang and Song, 2008)</ref>; however, the role of antioxidants in guard cells to modulate ROS concentrations has not been well studied. We observed flavonol and ROS accumulation in guard cells and showed that the concentrations of flavonols in planta are inversely proportional to ROS levels, consistent with in vitro studies of flavonols acting as antioxidants <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Rice-Evans et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hern√°ndez et al., 2009)</ref>. This study showed that flavonol levels are ethylene regulated in guard cells. Elevated levels of ethylene in response to exogenous treatment of the wild type and endogenous synthesis in the eto1 mutant increase flavonol accumulation in guard cells, resulting in decreased ROS levels and decreased rate of stomatal closure. Together these results indicate that flavonols suppress ROS levels in guard cells and thereby modulate the dynamics of stomatal aperture.</p></div>

Ethylene gas was added to achieve a 5 mL/L concentration of ethylene within the chamber. Control plants were placed in identical sealed containers without ethylene. After either 3 h or 24 h of incubation, leaves were excised and used for imaging DPBA or DCF fluorescence, or in stomatal closure assays.</p></div>

Whole leaves were then washed in deionized water for 1 min and mounted in deionized water between two coverslips. A Zeiss 710 LSCM was used to excite the leaf surfaces with 100% maximum laser power at 488 nm and a pinhole yielding a 4-mm cross section. We optimized LSCM settings to spectrally separate the fluorescence of flavonol-DPBA and chlorophyll by capturing the emission spectrum for each compound in which there is no overlap.

The gain settings were selected to maximize the total flavonol signal while preventing oversaturation. All micrographs within each figure were acquired using identical offset, gain, and pinhole settings using the same detectors. Postimage quantification of DPBA fluorescence intensities was done by placing a region of interest (ROI) around the nuclei of each guard cell and around an area in the cytosol with no chloroplasts present. The average intensity values within each ROI were recorded and averaged.</p></div>

For flavonol analysis, 10 ml of each sample was injected with a solvent of water:acetonitrile, both containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in the following gradients: 95% to 40% (v/v) water from 0 to 5 min, 40% to 20% (v/v) water from 5 to 20 min, and 20% to 95% (v/v) water from 20 to 23 min to recondition the column.
