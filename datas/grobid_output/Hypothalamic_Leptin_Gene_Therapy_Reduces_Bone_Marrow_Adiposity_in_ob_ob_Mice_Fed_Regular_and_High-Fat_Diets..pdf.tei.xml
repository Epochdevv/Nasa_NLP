<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity. Since osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from the same mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) progenitor, adipocyte formation may increase at the expense of osteoblast formation. Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone known to regulate energy and bone metabolism. Leptin deficiency and high-fat diet-induced obesity are associated with increased marrow adipose tissue (MAT) and reduced bone formation. Short-duration studies suggest that leptin treatment reduces MAT and increases bone formation in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice fed a regular diet. Here, we determined the long-duration impact of increased hypothalamic leptin on marrow adipocytes and osteoblasts in ob/ob mice following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) gene therapy. Eight-to 10-week-old male ob/ob mice were randomized into four groups: (1) untreated, (2) rAAV-Lep, (3) rAAV-green fluorescent protein (rAAV-GFP), or (4) pair-fed to rAAV-Lep. For vector administration, mice were injected intracerebroventricularly with either rAAV-leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep) or rAAV-GFP (9 × 10 7 particles) and maintained for 30 weeks. In a second study, the impact of increased hypothalamic leptin levels on MAT was determined in mice fed highfat diets; ob/ob mice were randomized into two groups and treated with either rAAV-Lep or rAAV-GFP. At 7 weeks post-vector administration, half the mice in each group were switched to a high-fat diet for 8 weeks. Wild-type (WT) controls included age-matched mice fed regular or high-fat diet. High-fat diet resulted in a threefold increase in MAT in WT mice, whereas MAT was increased by leptin deficiency up to 50-fold. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter with minor change in cancellous bone architecture. The gene therapy decreased MAT levels in ob/ ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet to values similar to WT mice fed regular diet. These findings suggest that leptin plays an important role in regulating the differentiation of MSCs to adipocytes and osteoblasts, a process that may be dysregulated by high-fat diet. However, the results also illustrate that reducing MAT by increasing leptin levels does not necessarily result in increased bone mass.</p></div>

Low bone mass is often associated with elevated bone marrow adiposity <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>. Bone marrow contains mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) capable of differentiating into cells of the osteoblastic and adipocytic lineages <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. A reciprocal relationship between the number of mature osteoblasts and bone marrow adipocytes may occur as a consequence of differentiation of MSCs toward one lineage at the expense of the other lineage <ref type="bibr">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>. Mechanistically, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), a transcription factor that plays a key role in regulation of adipogenesis and lipid uptake, has been implicated as a factor controlling MSC differentiation. Inhibition of PPARγ increases osteoblast differentiation while decreasing adipocyte differentiation. Osteoblast-targeted overexpression of PPARγ inhibits bone mass gain in male mice and increases ovariectomy-induced osteopenia in female mice (5). Furthermore, cultured adipocytes release factors capable of inducing osteoblast linage cells to differentiate into an adipocyte-like phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Thus, excessive marrow adipose tissue (MAT) has the potential to directly and/or indirectly reduce bone mass by inhibiting osteoblast differentiation. As such, an increase in MAT may contribute to osteoporosis in conditions, such as menopause, skeletal disuse, alcohol abuse, and eating disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9)</ref>.</p><p>Interestingly, anorexia and obesity both result in increased MAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11)</ref>. Anorexia is commonly associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk. By contrast, being overweight is generally associated with increased BMD and reduced fracture risk. However, recent studies suggest that morbid obesity has negative effects on bone quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. Thus, it is possible that the increase in MAT plays a role in the detrimental skeletal changes associated with both extremes in body weight.</p><p>Leptin, an adipokine produced in proportion to fat mass, plays a critical role in central nervous system-mediated regulation of energy homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. Additionally, leptin plays an important positive role in skeletal growth and maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>. Indeed, leptin signaling deficiency results in abnormal growth plate development <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref> and mild osteopetrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>.</p><p>Leptin suppresses PPARγ expression and increases lipolysis in adipose tissue in rodents <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. In parallel, leptin increases longitudinal bone growth, osteoblastogenesis and bone formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16)</ref>. Thus, the low leptin levels resulting from insufficient adipose tissue observed in anorexia may contribute to increased MAT and decreased bone formation. In contrast to anorexia, obesity typically results in increased leptin levels which, in turn, should suppress MAT. Many authors have concluded that leptin resistance plays an important role in hyperphagia and weight gain associated with obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Thus, leptin resistance may counteract the expected response to elevated leptin levels and thereby contribute to an increase in MAT during obesity. However, some new studies question whether resistance to endogenous leptin contributes to development of diet-induced obesity in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22)</ref>. If leptin resistance is a major contributor to the etiology of obesity, it may be overcome in normal rodents, at least in part, by increasing hypothalamic leptin levels. Whatever its precise role in diet-induced obesity, it is clear that leptin resistance resulting from loss of function of the leptin receptor (db/db mice), in addition to inducing morbid obesity, results in profound negative effects on the skeleton. Furthermore, some of these negative skeletal effects (e.g., reduced bone formation) are recapitulated, without impacting energy metabolism, following adoptive transfer of bone marrow from db/db mice into wild-type (WT) mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p><p>Leptin-deficient ob/ob and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice exhibit excessive MAT in long bones <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. Short-term delivery of leptin into the hypothalamus was shown to reduce peripheral fat depots as well as MAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>. However, the longterm effects of increased leptin levels on MAT have not been well characterized. Hypothalamic leptin gene therapy has been shown to result in life-long reductions in body weight in ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. The goal of the present study was to determine the long-duration effects of increased hypothalamic leptin, using recombinant adeno-associated virus leptin gene therapy (rAAV-Lep), on bone marrow adiposity in morbidly obese ob/ob mice. Given that the energy density of a diet impacts weight gain and MAT levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, the effects of a regular and high energy density (high fat) diet were also evaluated.</p></div>

Femora were prepared for histomorphometric evaluation as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. In brief, distal femora were dehydrated in graded increases of ethanol and xylene and embedded undecalcified in methyl methacrylate. Frontal sections (4 μm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2165) and affixed to slides precoated with a 1% gelatin solution. One section/ animal was stained for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for assessment of bone and cell-based measurements.</p><p>Histomorphometric data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25-1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate and 0.1 mm from cortical bone. Cancellous bone measurements included bone area fraction (bone area/tissue area, %) and the derived architectural indices of trabecular number (mm -1 ), trabecular thickness (micrometer), and trabecular separation (micrometer). Measurements of MAT included overall marrow adiposity (adipose area/tissue area, %), adipocyte density (mm -2 ), and adipocyte size (micrometers 2 ). Adipocytes were identified as large circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane and lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. This method has been validated by fat extraction and analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. Osteoblast and osteoclast perimeters were also measured and expressed as % of total bone perimeter. Osteoblasts were identified as plump cuboidal cells immediately adjacent to a thin layer of osteoid in direct contact with the bone perimeter. Osteoclasts were identified as multinucleated (two or more nuclei) cells with acid phosphatase positive (red-stained) cytoplasm in contact with the bone perimeter. Data are reported using standard two-dimensional nomenclature <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref>.</p></div>

Significant differences in cancellous bone area fraction, trabecular number, or trabecular spacing were not detected with treatment. However, trabecular thickness was lower in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated and rAAV-GFP-treated mice, but did not differ from pair-fed ob/ob mice. The effects of treatment on MAT in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. Marrow adiposity (adipose area/tissue area) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>), adipocyte density (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>), and adipocyte size (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>) were lower in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice. Significant differences among untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice were not detected for any of the MAT measurements. The effects of rAAV-Lep treatment on marrow adiposity can be readily appreciated in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D-G</ref>.</p><p>The effects of treatment on osteoblast perimeter and osteoclast perimeter in the distal femur metaphysis are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. Osteoblast perimeter (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>) and osteoclast perimeter (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2B</ref>) were higher in rAAV-Lep-treated mice compared to untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice. Significant differences among untreated, rAAV-GFP-treated, and pair-fed mice were not detected for either of the cellular endpoints evaluated. The effects of rAAV-Lep treatment on osteoblast and osteoclast perimeter can be appreciated in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2C-F</ref>.  <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. Body weight was higher in WT mice fed highfat diet compared to WT mice fed regular diet. Body weight was also higher in ob/ob mice fed high fat compared to ob/ob mice fed regular diet and rAAV-Lep treatment resulted in lower body weight. Cancellous bone area fraction, trabecular thickness, and trabecular number were higher and trabecular spacing was lower in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to WT mice fed regular diet. rAAV-Lep treatment in ob/ob mice resulted in lower cancellous bone area fraction and trabecular thickness. Significant differences in trabecular number or trabecular spacing were not detected with treatment in the ob/ob mice. With the exception of trabecular thickness, which was lower, significant differences between WT mice and rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice fed regular diets were not detected for any of the remaining cancellous endpoints evaluated.</p><p>The effects of treatment on marrow adiposity in distal femur metaphysis are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. Marrow adiposity and adipocyte size were higher in WT mice fed high-fat diet compared to mice fed regular diet. Significant differences in adipocyte density were not detected with diet in WT mice. rAAV-Lep treatment in ob/ob mice resulted in lower marrow adiposity due to lower adipocyte density as well as lower adipocyte size. Significant differences in marrow adiposity, adipocyte density, or adipocyte size were not detected between WT and rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice fed regular diet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DiscUssiOn</head><p>Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were heavier and had increased MAT in distal femur metaphysis compared to WT mice.

Based on lower adipocyte number and size and increased concentration of apoptosis marker caspase-3 in bone marrow adipocytes, the reduction in MAT was likely due to a combination of reduced adipocyte differentiation, increased fat oxidation, and increased adipocyte apoptosis. A similar reduction in MAT was observed following subcutaneous leptin administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</p><p>In normal female rats, hypothalamic delivery of rAAV-Lep was shown to maintain lower body weight, WAT weight, and serum leptin levels (2.7 ± 0.3 versus 1.0 ± 0.1 ng/ml) for at least 18 weeks following vector administration. By contrast, rAAV-Lep transiently reduced MAT; MAT levels were reduced at 5 weeks but returned to normal levels by 10 weeks following vector administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref>. Also, hypothalamic rAAV-Lep gene therapy was ineffective in lowering MAT in ovariectomized rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. In the present study, MAT levels in rAAV-Lep-treated ob/ob mice, evaluated 15 and 30 weeks following vector administration, were much lower than age-matched ob/ob controls and comparable to WT mice in Experiment 2. These findings suggest that (1) while very important, the physiological actions of leptin on MAT are primarily manifested at low hormone levels and (2) hyperleptinemia has little further effect on MAT. If correct, this could help explain why some studies fail to detect a relationship between blood leptin levels and MAT (1). The findings regarding the actions of leptin on MAT are remarkably similar to the actions of the hormone on bone growth, maturation, and turnover. Whereas hypothalamic rAAV-Lep gene therapy corrected the skeletal abnormalities in ob/ob mice, it had minimal long-term impact on bone in rodents capable of producing leptin <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>. It was initially hypothesized that the complex skeletal phenotype of ob/ob mice was due to opposing actions of peripheral and central leptin on bone formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41)</ref>. However, subcutaneous and intracerebroventricular delivery of leptin were found to similarly increase bone formation in ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. Additionally, longduration hypothalamic leptin gene therapy was shown to normalize bone microarchitecture in ob/ob mice; specifically, increasing hypothalamic leptin levels resulted in increased femur length and total femur bone volume but decreased cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>. These latter findings imply that, in addition to increasing longitudinal bone growth, delivery of leptin into the hypothalamus results in increased bone formation as well as increased bone resorption. Thus, an imbalance between bone formation and resorption related to local environment (e.g., precursor cell populations, mechanical loads, paracrine factors, etc.) potentially explains the contrasting phenotypes that have been identified in bones of the limb and spine in ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>.</p><p>Bone-and bone compartment-specific changes in microarchitecture in response to hormonal regulators of bone metabolism and mechanical loading environment are not unique to leptin. For example, by regulating longitudinal and radial bone growth and bone turnover balance, estrogens, and androgens contribute to sexual dimorphism of the skeleton. In this regard, administration of estrogen to growing ovariectomized rats results in shorter bones with lower total bone mass but higher site-specific cancellous bone volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref>. Ovariectomized rats also experience increased MAT expansion <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref>. ob/ob mice of both genders are hypogonadal due to reduced GnRH secretion <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>, a defect that is reversed following leptin treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. Thus, it is possible that hypogonadism contributes to MAT expansion in ob/ob mice. Expansion of MAT during caloric restriction in WT mice was associated with increased circulation of glucocorticoids, while caloric restriction resulted in a further increase in the already high levels of MAT in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. These findings provide evidence that multiple factors, including leptin, regulate MAT levels. As previously mentioned, short-duration delivery of leptin into the hypothalamus increased bone formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. Similarly, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased serum osteocalcin levels and osteoblast perimeter in lumbar vertebra of ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>. In the present study, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy increased osteoblast perimeter in distal femur metaphysis in ob/ ob mice 30 weeks following vector administration. These findings indicate that leptin promotes higher levels of bone formation prior to and following restoration of normal body weight and bone mass in ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p><p>The increased cancellous bone volume fraction observed at selected skeletal sites (lumbar vertebrae) in ob/ob mice was initially attributed to increased bone formation, suggesting that leptin was antiosteogenic <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. However, subsequent studies consistently reported decreased bone formation in ob/ob mice and leptin receptor-deficient db/db mice, and increased bone formation following intracerebroventricular delivery of leptin, leptin gene therapy, or subcutaneous administration of leptin in ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref>. Leptin signaling-deficient (ob/ob and db/db) mice have normal or increased osteoclast number but exhibit evidence for impaired osteoclast function <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18)</ref>. As a consequence, these mice exhibit impaired skeletal maturation due to defective resorption of calcified cartilage. Specifically, the high cancellous bone volume fraction represents mild osteopetrosis. In the present study in ob/ob mice, rAAV-Lep resulted in increased osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. Thus, the failure to detect an increase in cancellous bone volume fraction in the femur metaphysis in response to higher leptin levels is likely due to parallel increases in bone formation and bone resorption.</p><p>High MAT levels in ob/ob mice are associated with low cancellous bone turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. In the present study, rAAV-Lep resulted in increases in osteoclast-lined perimeter as well as osteoblastlined bone perimeter and greatly reduced MAT with minimal change in cancellous bone area fraction. High MAT levels are not unique to leptin deficiency. Growth hormone deficiency in rats and mice induced by hypophysectomy or deletion of the gene for growth hormone, respectively, is also associated with high MAT and low bone turnover. In the case of growth hormone deficiency, parathyroid hormone was found to increase bone formation in hypophysectomized rats without impacting MAT levels, demonstrating that bone formation induced by bone anabolic agents is not suppressed by high levels of MAT <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. Similarly, although bone formation was increased, the absence of MAT in kit W/W-v mice did not protect against ovariectomy-induced bone loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. Taken together, these findings suggest that bone resorption as well as bone formation can be impacted during changes in MAT levels and interventions that target MAT may not necessarily change bone turnover balance.</p><p>0 40 80 120 RCD HFD RCD HFD RCD HFD N.Ad/T.Ar (#/mm 2 ) Adipocyte Density 0 400 800 1200 1600 RCD HFD RCD HFD RCD HFD Ad.Ar (µm 2 ) Adipocyte Size rAAV-GFP rAAV-Lep rAAV-GFP rAAV-Lep 0 4 8 12 16 RCD HFD RCD HFD RCD HFD Ad.Ar/T.Ar (%) A positive association between body weight and bone mass was observed in ob/ob as well as WT mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>. However, leptin appears to sensitize the skeleton to bone mechanical loading. This may explain why leptin-deficient mice have a low total bone mass even though they are morbidly obese and why the massive weight loss in ob/ob mice following leptin treatment is actually associated with a net increase in bone mass <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</p><p>Conditional knockout of the leptin receptor in bone marrow stromal cells has been reported to result in local increases in osteogenesis and decreased adipogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. It is difficult to reconcile these findings with the skeletal phenotype of leptin receptor-deficient mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49)</ref> or with the present results demonstrating that increasing hypothalamic leptin levels profoundly reduces MAT levels. Evidence that factors secondary to leptin deficiency are responsible for the discrepancy, as suggested by Yue et al., are presently lacking and correction of many of the metabolic abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency (e.g., hyperglycemia), rather than improving, actually worsens the skeletal phenotype of ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>. Also inexplicable by Yue et al. is the finding that adoptive transfer of leptin receptor-deficient db/db bone marrow cells into WT mice recapitulates the low bone formation skeletal phenotype of db/db mice without impacting food intake or weight gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>. It is possible that the role of leptin receptors in regulating bone metabolism depends upon stage of stromal cell differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(50)</ref>, but this requires additional research.</p><p>A limitation of the present study is that MAT measurements were performed at a single skeletal site and MAT subtypes were not evaluated. The lipid composition and physiological function of MAT can vary with location and/or regulatory factors, such as growth hormone status <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51)</ref>. A further limitation of most studies, including the present study, is that they have been performed housing mice at room temperature. Thermoneutral (temperature range where basal rate of energy production is at equilibrium with heat loss) in mice ranges from 26 to 34°C <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(52)</ref>. Mild cold stress induced by room temperature housing results in dramatic cancellous bone loss at the femur metaphysis. Interestingly, mice housed at 32°C consumed ~40% less food (fed ad libitum) but did not differ from room temperature-housed mice in weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(53)</ref>. In addition to higher bone mass, mice housed at 32°C had greatly reduced UCP-1 gene expression in brown fat, higher serum leptin, higher MAT levels due to increased adipocyte number, higher bone formation rate to due higher osteoblast perimeter, and lower osteoclast perimeter. These findings suggest that non-shivering thermogenesis substantially influences the association between leptin, MAT, and bone cells.</p><p>In summary, hypothalamic leptin gene therapy maintained low MAT levels in ob/ob mice fed regular or high-fat diet. The reduction in MAT was accompanied by an increase in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter but not an increase in cancellous bone volume fraction. The increase in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter suggests that the increase in bone formation was matched by an increase in bone resorption. These findings provide further evidence that a deterministic model where reducing MAT will invariably lead to increased bone volume is not tenable. As a consequence, interventions targeted at reducing MAT may not be an effective strategy for increasing bone mass.</p></div>
