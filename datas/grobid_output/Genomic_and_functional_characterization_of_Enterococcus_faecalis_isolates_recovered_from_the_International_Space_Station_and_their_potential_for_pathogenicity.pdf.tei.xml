<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Enterococcus faecalis is a multidrug resistant, opportunistic human pathogen and a leading cause of hospital acquired infections. Recently, isolates have been recovered from the air and surfaces onboard the International Space Station (ISS). Pangenomic and functional analyses were carried out to assess their potential impact on astronaut health. Genomes of each ISS isolate, and both clinical and commensal reference strains, were evaluated for their core and unique gene content, acquired antibiotic resistance genes, phage, plasmid content, and virulence traits. In order to determine their potential survival when outside of the human host, isolates were also challenged with three weeks of desiccation at 30% relative humidity. Finally, pathogenicity of the ISS strains was evaluated in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. At the culmination of this study, there were no defining signatures that separated known pathogenic strains from the more commensal phenotypes using the currently available resources. As a result, the current reliance on database information alone must be shifted to experimentally evaluated genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of clinically relevant microorganisms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Enterococcus faecalis represent a core, yet quantitatively minor portion of the human gut microbiome <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Schloissnig et al., 2013)</ref> that are well suited to persist outside of the host environment. Evidence recently emerged that the enterococci may have split from their last common ancestor at approximately the time animal life began to colonize terrestrial habitats (âˆ¼425 million years ago), and traits that promote survival and transmission in the exposed land environment selected for the characteristic ruggedness of the genus <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lebreton et al., 2017)</ref>. Supporting that proposition, enterococci display significantly higher levels of resistance to a variety of antiseptics, salts, organic compounds, desiccation, and starvation than ancestral outgroups <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lebreton et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Because traits contributing to environmental persistence also contribute to persistence in the hospital environment, enterococci rank among leading causes of healthcare associated infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Weiner et al., 2016)</ref>. While certain strains of E. faecalis are pathogenic for hospitalized patients, e.g., MMH594 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Huycke et al., 1991)</ref> and V583 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Sahm et al., 1989)</ref>, and possess genomes swollen to 3.3 Mb by the accretion of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), the genomes of commensal isolates are 25% smaller, as typified by the strain OG1RF <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bourgogne et al., 2008)</ref>. In the antibiotic era, loss of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) protection of the chromosome further facilitated the accumulation of additional antibiotic resistance by enterococci <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fiore et al., 2019)</ref>. Several other MGEs have been directly linked to virulence factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Shankar et al., 2002)</ref>, however, the selective value of most mobile elements in clinical isolates of enterococci remains to be determined.</p><p>The ISS provides a unique opportunity to study the establishment of a microbiome in what originated as a clean, hermetically sealed built environment, where the influx of new microorganisms only occurs periodically with the arrival of new crew and supplies. The microbiome of the ISS has been extensively characterized in recent years by metagenomic <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Be et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Singh et al., 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Urbaniak et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blaustein et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mora et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sielaff et al., 2019)</ref> and culture-based investigations <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schiwon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Venkateswaran, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Singh et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blaustein et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mora et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sobisch et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Urbaniak et al., 2019)</ref>, yet only recently have these effort been combined <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mora et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sielaff et al., 2019)</ref>. The results are divided among those that report similarities to Earth built environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schiwon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mora et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sielaff et al., 2019)</ref> including United States based spacecraft assembly cleanrooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Be et al., 2017)</ref>, and those that detected significant differences from terrestrial residences, the Human Microbiome Project <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lang et al., 2017)</ref>, the Japan-based ISS analog module <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ichijo et al., 2016)</ref>, and a French Guiana-based cleanroom <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mora et al., 2019)</ref>. Despite the differences in methodologies and results, the detection of opportunistic human pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schiwon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Be et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mora et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Singh et al., 2018a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sielaff et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sobisch et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Urbaniak et al., 2019</ref>) including E. faecalis, is a common phenomenon. With the exception of <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Be et al. (2017)</ref>, the previous metagenomic efforts were limited to characterizing diversity at the genus level or identifying antibiotic resistance or virulence gene content, and thereby lacked the genetic resolution to confidently identify pathogenic bacterial strains. While genome-based pathogenicity analyses have been performed for Staphylococcus aureus <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blaustein et al., 2019)</ref> and Enterobacter bugandensis <ref type="bibr">(Singh et al., 2018a)</ref>, only a single culture-based report has quantified pathogenicity (Fusarium oxysporum isolates from the ISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Urbaniak et al., 2019)</ref> in a host model. As a result, the ability to predict how opportunistic pathogens may impact crew health remains unclear.</p><p>In addition to characterizing the microbiome of the ISS, understanding the effects of spaceflight on bacterial physiology will be imperative for assessing the impacts on crew health. When Pseudomonas aeruginosa was exposed to spaceflight, there was an increase in the total cell viable numbers, biomass, biofilm thickness, and the cells produced a unique biofilm architecture not seen in ground controls of the species <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Mclean et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kim et al., 2013)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Su et al. (2014)</ref> documented growth curve, transcriptomic, and proteomic alterations (related to amino acid transport, metabolism, energy production, and conversion) in Bacillus cereus and Serratia marcescens during spaceflight <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Wang et al., 2014)</ref>. Carbon utilization profiles were altered among S. marcescens clones after flight, and transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed significant changes in metabolic functions <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Wang et al., 2014)</ref>. Additionally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wilson et al. (2007)</ref> utilized proteomic analysis and expression profiles to demonstrate that changes in genomic regulation of Salmonella typhymurium were widely distributed, and virulence was increased in response to spaceflight. Although <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Hammond et al. (2013)</ref> report a significant decrease in E. faecalis OG1RF virulence when grown under spaceflight conditions, this was inferred by a reduction in the optical density of cultures grown in the presence of adult Caenorhabditis elegans rather than worm viability.</p><p>In addition to altered microbial physiological responses, astronaut health is also impacted by the spaceflight environment. Factors such as microgravity, physiological stress, isolation, abnormal circadian rhythms, and altered nutrition have been shown to weaken an astronaut's immunity in as little as 10 to 15 days <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Crucian et al., 2013)</ref>, and these effects can persist up to 6 months post mission ISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Crucian et al., 2015)</ref>. This weakened immunity, combined with the prevalence of E. faecalis strains, or other potential pathogens including viruses <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rooney et al., 2019)</ref>, could result in severe human health consequences on board the ISS, even in incidences of routine medicinal procedures (i.e., the introduction of a percutaneous catheter <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Mermel, 2012)</ref>.</p><p>With the detection of enterococci, we sought to determine the risk they posed to residents within the ISS -specifically, do they represent pathogenic lineages commonly associated with infections in hospitals, or do they represent commensals shed into the environment as a consequence of human habitation? In order to determine if the challenging environment of the air and surfaces of the ISS have selected for pathogenic strains of E. faecalis, we coupled previously employed genomic data analyses <ref type="bibr">(Singh et al., 2018a)</ref> with phenotypic characterization of E. faecalis isolates recovered onboard the ISS. By assessing their antibiotic resistance, desiccation tolerance, and pathogenicity in the well-established C. elegans model <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Garsin et al., 2001)</ref>, we sought to test existing methods for identification of strains of E. faecalis with a high likelihood of causing in-flight infections.</p></div>

E. faecalis isolates OG1RF, MMH594, V583, and the genome sequences of E. faecalis 5952 and JH-1 were made available from the Gilmore lab strain collection. All additional available whole genomes of E. faecalis (N = 44) were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).</p><p>Except where described below, cultures of E. faecalis OG1RF, MMH594, V583, and the ISS isolates (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) were grown aerobically with shaking (250 RPM) at 37 â€¢ C in brain heart infusion (BHI; Difco TM , cat. no: 237500) broth. Growth kinetics for each isolate was assessed using a Synergy 2 microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.), measuring optical density at 620 nm. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for various antibiotics was evaluated in both Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth or in BHI, as further detailed below. For the desiccation experiments, isolates were grown overnight in a chemically defined medium (CDM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Hussain et al., 1991)</ref> and plated onto M9 (Difco TM , cat. no: 237500) agar plates amended with 1.0% glucose. To perform the C. elegans pathogenicity assays, cultures of Escherichia coli OP50 were prepared on nematode growth media (NGM) agar plates as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Powell and Ausubel, 2008)</ref>.</p></div>

Purified DNA was used for preparing libraries, which were then sequenced on Illumina HiSeq (250 nucleotide paired end reads) as previously described (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref> in <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Lebreton et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Additionally, a MinION (Oxford Nanopore TechnologiesÂ©; ONT) library was prepared using the "one-pot" barcoding protocol, as developed by Josh Quick and the Loman Lab 1 . For each isolate, 24 ÂµL of AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter R Life Sciences cat. no.: A63880) eluate was used as input for library preparation. This was incubated at room temperature (RT) for 5 min, 65 â€¢ C for 5 min, then placed on ice for 30 s. Samples were barcoded using the Rapid Barcoding Kit (ONT cat. no.: SQK-RBK001) and each was incubated at RT for 10 min, 70 â€¢ C for 5 min, then placed on ice. The reaction product was then pooled with other samples (N = 4 total) in a clean 1.5 mL low-bind Eppendorf tube, before addition of 26.75 Âµl AMPure XP beads per sample. This was incubated at RT for 5 min, placed on the magnet rack until clear, and the supernatant removed. The beads were washed with 200 Âµl 70% ethanol, incubated for 30 s, and the supernatant removed (2X) before spinning down and removal of the residual 70% ethanol. After air drying for 1 min, the beads were resuspended in 31 Âµl elution buffer (EB, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8), incubated off the magnet rack for 5 min, returned to the rack. DNA was quantified by fluorescence (ThermoFisher ScientificÂ© Qubit 3.0 with Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit; cat. no.: Q32854) and the sequencing adaptors were ligated (ONT cat. no.: SQK-LSK109) following the manufacturer's protocols. This tube was incubated at RT for 10 min, 45.5 Âµl AMPure XP beads added, incubated for another 5 min, placed on magnet rack until clear, and the supernatant removed. Next, 150 Âµl ABB was added and the beads resuspended by flicking, before placing the tube back on the magnet rack until clear. The supernatant was removed and the ABB wash repeated before spinning down the tube and removing the residual supernatant. Next, 12 ul EB was added and the bead resuspended by flicking before incubation at RT for 5 min. The tube was placed again on the magnet rack until clear, and the elution library was loaded on to an ONT MinION flow cell (R9.4.1) according to the manufacturer's protocols and sequenced using MinKNOW (v1.11.5) with live basecalling (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">S2</ref>). Output fastq files were concatenated and adaptors were removed and debarcoded with PoreChop (v0.2.3<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">foot_3</ref> ).

Briefly, overnight cultures of isolates were diluted and 10 4 cells in MH broth were inoculated into each well of 96 well plates containing serial 2-fold dilutions of antibiotics. Maximum concentration tested: penicillin (10 Âµg mL -1 ), amoxicillin (10 Âµg mL -1 ), ampicillin (10 Âµg mL -1 ), oxacillin (256 Âµg mL -1 ), erythromycin (50 Âµg mL -1 ), and tetracycline (64 Âµg mL -1 ). This procedure was repeated in BHI <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McBride et al., 2007)</ref>, and isolates were additionally evaluated for high level aminoglycoside resistance (HLGR) with: gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin (each at a maximum concentration of 2 mg mL -1 ).

E. faecalis isolates were harvested from stationary phase by centrifugation, and washed twice with sterile (autoclaved, 0.22 Âµm filtered) water (sH 2 O). Prior to desiccation, the concentrated cells were resuspended in CDM, and a 10 ÂµL sample was track diluted <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Jett et al., 1997)</ref> onto M9 medium (M9; Amresco R , cat. no.: J863-500G) amended with 0.1% glucose agar, and incubated at 37 â€¢ C. After âˆ¼24 h, the number of CFUs recovered from 10 ÂµL track dilutions prepared according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Jett et al. (1997)</ref> were used to determine the original concentration of cells mL -1 (t = -1). Aliquots of cell suspensions (50 ÂµL) were spotted onto autoclaved coverslips, and placed into the desiccation chamber containing Drierite R (â‰¥ 98% CaSO 4 , W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Ltd., cat. no.: 778-18-9) until the liquid evaporated (t = 0, 24 h). The relative humidity (RH) in the chamber was monitored using a digital hygrometer, and maintained between 30-40% by adding additional Drierite R . Three replicates were prepared for each isolate at each timepoint. The dried cells were removed from the coverslips by rinsing and resuspending the material with a pipet into 1 mL of sH 2 O. To ensure the samples were homogenously resuspended, rehydrated cells were incubated at 37 â€¢ C for 1 h while shaking (225 RPM), and vortexed for 15 minutes. The cells were then serially diluted into sH 2 O and 10 ÂµL track dilutions were plated onto M9 agar. At the t = 0 time point, the number of CFUs recovered from the substrate was designated as the starting population size that survived the initial drying on the coverslip (N 0 ). Subsequent samples were removed from the desiccation chamber every three days and rehydrated as described above to determine the number of surviving CFUs over time (N). The surviving fraction of cells was determined from the ratio of N/N 0 . Each time point was evaluated when N was â‰¥ 30 CFU.</p></div>

ISS_1 was determined to be a single locus variant of sequence type (ST) 875, with a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 583 bases of pstS. Isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 were identified as ST30. ISS_4 was classified as ST40, a commonly recovered ST and a member of one of the largest clonal clusters, CC40 <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McBride et al., 2007)</ref>. A clonal cluster is defined as a ST consisting of three or more isolates <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McBride et al., 2007)</ref>.

Seven of the 11 unique genes formed a contiguous region suggestive of an operon, which contained two genes with known annotations, mazG, which encodes a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase involved in survival under nutrient stress, and another that encodes an LPxTGmotif protein cell wall anchor domain protein. Neither ISS_2 (Accession no.: CP046112) nor ISS_3 (Accession no.: CP046111) contained individually unique genes. Consistent with this finding, analysis of the core alignment revealed that isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3 differed by only 14 bases. However, these two isolates shared 39 genes that were not present in any of the other strains analyzed, of which 30 were classified as hypothetical. ISS_4 (Accession no.: CP046108-110) had 25 unique genes, 16 of which were located on a plasmid (pTEF2); no unique genes were found on the second (pAD1) plasmid. Based on BLASTn analysis (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S2</ref>), the majority of genes unique to the ISS strains are closely related to genes present in Enterococcus species, with all non-Enterococcus genera restricted to Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and, with lower identity and query coverage, Listeria (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S3</ref>).</p><p>Following the designations of <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McBride et al.

In addition, the E. faecalis genomes of strains 5952 and JH-1 were chosen as representative ST strains of the ISS isolates ISS_2 and ISS_3, and ISS_4, respectively. While the amount of information that can be gleaned from a complete genome is large, the current methodologies <ref type="bibr">(Singh et al., 2018a)</ref> are insufficient for the accurate assessment of pathogenicity for E. faecalis strains. The scores from the tool, PathogenFinder <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Cosentino et al., 2013)</ref>, predicted each of the ISS isolates as possessing &gt; 84% probability of being pathogenic to humans, placing them above known clinical isolates MMH594 and V583 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Another tool related to scoring pathogenicity, VirFinder, identified twenty virulence factors among the ISS strains, but fifteen were present in the commensal isolate OG1RF as well (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). We cautiously interpret this to mean that ISS isolates do share some of the potentially virulence-related properties found in clinical isolates, but many of these are also shared by prototype commensal strains of E. faecalis. Further validation for these predictive algorithms applied to enterococci is needed in order to make more accurate predictions of which strains could impact human health. Predictions from PathogenFinder or its equivalent can be expected to improve if additional training data at the genus or species level is incorporated.  Because of the difficulty in interpreting potential pathogenicity of the ISS strains based on genome content alone, we tested them directly in the C. elegans infection model (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). Previous studies identified parallels in the pathogenicity profiles of various enterococcal lineages when tested in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Garsin et al., 2001)</ref> and in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bourgogne et al., 2008)</ref>. In contrast to that report <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Garsin et al., 2001)</ref>, we did not detect significant difference in C. elegans survival when exposed to commensal OG1RF, or pathogenic V583 and the cytolytic strain MMH594. E. faecalis proliferate in the intestine of C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Garsin et al., 2001)</ref> ultimately occluding it <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">(Yuen and Ausubel, 2018)</ref>.

None of the E. faecalis strains tested here, including ISS strains, exhibited enhanced C. elegans killing (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). Closely related strains ISS_2 and 3, despite possessing a high computed pathogenicity score, were found to be least able to kill C. elegans (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>).</p><p>Additionally, there are currently no validated methods to predict phenotypic responses of enterococci to environmental stressors (e.g., desiccation, starvation, increased cosmic radiation) based on their genomic content alone. Because each of the ISS isolates were recovered from air and surface samples, we examined them specifically for the ability to survive desiccation at RH relevant to the clinical environment <ref type="bibr">(ASHRAE, 2013)</ref>. In general, members of the genus Enterococcus are more desiccation tolerant than closely related microorganisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lebreton et al., 2017)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blaustein et al.

(2018)</ref> compared the genomes of the highly resistant B. safensis FO-36b and B. pumilus SAFR-032 to over 60 reference strains, and also failed to find genomic signatures for their increased environmental resistances (e.g., desiccation, starvation, increased ultraviolet radiation). Rather, it is more likely the regulation of a suite of genes that confers increased resistance as a generalized stress response. In agreement with <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Blaustein et al. (2019)</ref> we conclude that the interior space environment (e.g., microgravity, increased cosmic radiation) selects for intrinsically rugged species of bacteria, such as E. faecalis, but as of yet, there is no evidence suggesting selection for enhanced environmental persistence.</p><p>In agreement with previous observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schiwon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sobisch et al., 2019)</ref>, the E. faecalis isolates examined here were resistant to multiple antibiotics. While the detection of multidrug resistant bacteria may sound alarming, much of that resistance is intrinsic to all enterococci, and other genetic signatures indicate that these are largely commensal strains (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>). However, resistance to tetracycline displayed by ISS_2, ISS_3, and ISS_4 was found to be mediated by an acquired tetW/N/W gene, which confers an MIC equivalent to that of clinical isolates (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). In addition to harboring genes that make combating infections difficult, E. faecalis strains possess the ability to spread antibiotic resistance to genes to other bacterial species, including the commonly isolated ISS inhabitant S. aureus <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Sobisch et al., 2019)</ref>. Although there have been no reports of VRE isolated from onboard the ISS at the time of this publication, it is important to note that both vancomycin resistance genes and E. faecalis genomic signatures were detected concurrently from the surface of the dining table during expedition 43 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Singh et al., 2018b)</ref>. During the same mission, E. faecalis was also ranked the second most abundant BSL-2 microorganism in the metagenomic analysis of the entire campaign <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Singh et al., 2018b)</ref>. In fact, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mora et al. (2019)</ref> determined Enterococcus to be one of the ten indicator genera that distinguished the ISS microbiome from the human and indoor samples of the Home Microbiome Project <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Mora et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>There were several limitations to the data presented above. The desiccation survival experiments were terminated before any significant decrease in viability was observed. Extending the experiment until no surviving cells remained may have revealed a difference in the survival curves among the strains and provide insight to the length of time E. faecalis can remain viable. The lack of experimentally validated computational tools for E. faecalis led to conflicting results when comparing the genomes known clinical isolates to commensal strains. In addition, C. elegans serves as a rudimentary model system for human infection.</p><p>However, the challenges presented here provide the foundation for future investigations of E. faecalis, on Earth or in space.</p><p>As members of the core gut microbiome, E. faecalis will continue to be transported to the ISS and the ability to detect pathogenic strains will be beneficial for crew health. Unlike most environmental bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Staley and Konopka, 1985)</ref>, E. faecalis strains are routinely recovered on culture media. Based on the antibiotic resistance profiles presented here, incorporating the above high-level aminoglycosides to the routine onboard culturing activities could serve as the first step toward distinguishing pathogenic from commensal strains of E. faecalis. Because of their commonness as survivors on abiotic surfaces, their potential ability to infect, as well as the ability of E. faecalis to readily acquire and spread mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance, continued microbial monitoring and pathogen identification will be important.</p><p>Current microbial monitoring of ISS air and surface sampling occurs once a month for the first 90 days of a mission, and decreases to one sample event for every 90 days thereafter <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(ISS-MORD, 2013)</ref>. Because these microbial monitoring procedures are culture based, there is an inherent bias toward the small fraction of bacterial species that will form a colony on a plate <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Staley and Konopka, 1985)</ref>. Assessing the total microbial burden, and viable fraction, by combining genomic and culture-based analyses provides a more accurate representation of the ISS microbiome <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Be et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mora et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sielaff et al., 2019)</ref>. However, it is still unclear which, if any, of these microorganisms are relevant to crew health <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Schiwon et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Be et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lang et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Singh et al., 2018a,b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Mora et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Sielaff et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Sobisch et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Urbaniak et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>The need for expedient identification of pathogenic microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles is not a challenge unique to the spaceflight environment. Recent advances in rapid diagnostics have helped alleviate the clinical reliance on culture based techniques to identify infectious agents, yet these resources are not always widely available <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Maurer et al., 2017)</ref>. Fortunately, this is not the case for the ISS where the crew have access to Wetlab-2 CepheidÂ© SmartCycyler that can be used for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of air, surface, water, and clinical samples 3 . Although it is currently configured to detect only a limited number of microbial pathogens, the RAZOR TM EX BioDetection System (Idaho Technology Inc.) is currently being developed for in-flight microbial monitoring and could be modified for a wider range of microbial targets. Another promising technology for pathogen detection is the ONT MinION sequencing device employed above. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Castro-Wallace et al. (2017)</ref> have previously validated its efficacy in the spacecraft environment. The MinION is currently capable of identifying bacterial species in near real time from metagenomic data <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Sanderson et al., 2018)</ref> or isolated samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gargis et al., 2019)</ref> and has been used for the first ever off-Earth identification of bacteria cultured and sequenced in flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Burton et al., 2020)</ref>.</p><p>Due to the inability for the existing tools to distinguish pathogenic from commensal strains of E. faecalis, we make the following recommendations: Rather than continuing to wait 3 <ref type="url" target="https://www.nasa.gov/spacebio/microbiology/hardware">https://www.nasa.gov/spacebio/microbiology/hardware</ref> for sample return and analysis using the current unvalidated databases, we suggest performing an initial screen for HLGR. Then, any isolates exhibiting HLGR should be sequenced using the MinION and evaluated for the presence of the type 2 capsule <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(McBride et al., 2007)</ref>, the vancomycin resistance operon observed in V583 <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Paulsen et al., 2003)</ref>, components of the pathogenicity island (e.g., cytolysin production loci and the enterococcal surface protein, Esp), and the absence of functional CRISPR-Cas arrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Van Tyne et al., 2019)</ref>. This information would then provide near real-time information for the crew regarding the need for additional decontamination procedures. These advancements would not be limited to E. faecalis isolates, however more accurate genomic targets for additional pathogen detection will need to be experimentally validated <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Chiu and Miller, 2019)</ref>. With the development of such targets, multiple pathogens (including bacteria, fungi, and viruses) can quickly be identified within a single sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Miller et al., 2019)</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | Isolate recovery locations on the International Space Station.
