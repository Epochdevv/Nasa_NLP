<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinase (PERK) gene family is crucial to various molecular and cellular processes in plants. We identified 50 PERK genes in Brassica napus to explore their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles. These genes were grouped into four classes and unevenly distributed across 18 chromosomes. Phylogenetic studies and Ka/Ks ratios revealed purifying selection during the evolution process. They exhibited significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, suggesting specialized function. Gene structure and motif analyses revealed variations among the BnPERK family members, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Cis-element analysis predicted the involvement in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling showed diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, highlighting potential roles in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein-protein interaction networks suggested BnPERK proteins interact with a wide array of proteins, implicating them in multiple biological processes. The transcriptional downregulation of four BnPERK genes upon Plasmodiophora brassicae infection implied a role in clubroot disease response. Furthermore, the Arabidopsis perk9 mutant displayed relieved disease severity and enhanced basal immune response, suggesting the negative role of PERK9 in plant immunity. The study highlighted the potential role of BnPERKs in crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) constitute the largest plant receptor family and are located on the cell surface to perceive and transduce a wide range of signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. By initiating intracellular signaling cascades, RLKs play pivotal roles in various molecular and cellular processes, including plant development, stress response, and signal transduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. These versatile receptors are capable of sensing plant hormones, secreted peptides, and molecules derived from pathogens involved in plant defense response <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. For example, RLKs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which trigger the Pattern-Triggered Immunity (PTI) response, activating signaling pathways that defend against pathogen invasion.</p><p>RLKs typically consist of three key domains: an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The extracellular domain, characterized by significant structural diversity, forms the basis for classifying RLKs into different subclasses based on their motif structures. Among these, the proline-rich extensin-like receptor kinases (PERKs) represent a distinct group characterized by a proline-rich extracellular domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Interestingly, while some PERKs like BnPERK1 and AtPERK4 locate on the plasma membrane, AtPERK13 has been demonstrated to anchor to the cell wall <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Functionally, the intracellular kinase domain of RLKs contains conserved motifs that exhibit kinase activity, which has been observed in BnPERK1 and AtPERK4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>In Arabidopsis thaliana, the PERK gene family consists of 15 members, some of which show specific expression patterns in roots and floral organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. However, some AtPERK genes exhibit broad expression patterns across various tissues, such as AtPERK1, which is ubiquitously expressed, suggesting its involvement in diverse molecular and cellular processes. Recent studies have elucidated the regulation of PERKs in response to different stress conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. For example, the expression of TaPERKs in wheat and GhPERKs in cotton is significantly influenced by abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, and salinity <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. In A. thaliana, AtPERK13 has been shown to respond to nutrient deficiencies such as phosphate, nitrogen, and iron deprivation, highlighting the role of PERKs in maintaining nutrient homeostasis and adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In rice, the PERK gene Z15 is activated by moderately low temperatures, emphasizing the adaptability of PERKs to diverse environmental cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Additionally, PERKs have been implicated in plant defense against pathogens. For example, the expression of TaPERKs is influenced by fungal pathogens, and BnPERK1 has been shown to respond to the pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. In summary, PERKs are versatile players in response to various stresses.</p><p>PERKs also play essential roles in plant hormone signaling. Several studies have highlighted the involvement of PERKs in the regulation of growth and development in response to hormonal signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. For instance, AtPERK4 has been implicated in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling during root cell elongation <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Furthermore, the expression profiles of OsPERKs and GhPERKs have shown differential expression patterns under different plant hormone treatments, including ABA, methyl jasmona (MeJA), gibberellin (GA), salicylic acid (SA), and auxin <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. The intricate regulation of PERKs by different plant hormones suggests their pivotal role in integrating hormonal signaling pathways to coordinate plant growth and stress responses.</p><p>In summary, PERK genes are known to be critical to plant growth, development, and stress responses. Despite the essential roles of PERKs in various processes across various plant species, comprehensive studies on the PERK gene family in Brassica napus (oilseed rape), an economically important crop serving as both an edible oil source and animal feed, are still limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This allopolyploid species (AACC, 2n = 38), formed by the hybridization between two diploid ancestors, B. rapa (AA = 20) and B. oleracea (CC = 18), emerged approximately 6800 to 12,500 years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. While a comprehensive study of BrPERK genes has been completed in male-sterile B. rapa plants, identifying <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> BrPERK genes and exploring their potential role in male sterility, studies in B. napus remain scarce <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>This study aimed to provide a comprehensive study of BnPERK genes to include the exploration of its evolutionary history, chromosome location, and gene structure through various computational approaches. Tissue-specific and hormone treatment gene expression patterns were examined using available transcriptome datasets. Additionally, the study also investigated the role of BnPERKs in response to the obligate pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae, which causes clubroot disease in Brassica species. By providing insights into the molecular and functional roles of BnPERKs, this study will contribute to a deeper understanding of this often-overlooked plant receptor subfamily and its potential applications in crop improvement.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis of BnPERKs in Brassica napus</head><p>Fifty PERK genes were identified within the B. napus 'ZS11' genome (Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">S2</ref> and <ref type="table">S3</ref>). Identification was accomplished through an extensive BLAST search using 15 AtPERK sequences, revealing a higher number of BnPERK genes compared with those reported in Arabidopsis, Chinese cabbage, soybean, rice, sorghum, maize, cotton, and wheat (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>). The BnPERK family of proteins exhibited varying lengths, ranging from 187 to 921 amino acids. Their molecular weights (MWs) spanned from 20.63 to 102.21 kDa, with BnPERK15C2 and BnPERK15A2 representing the extremes. Additionally, the isoelectric points (pIs) ranged from 5.26 to 8.59 (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>). The data plots illustrated that BnPERK proteins exhibit a broad spectrum of MW and pI. Moreover, predictions of subcellular localization suggested that most BnPERK proteins were located on the plasma membrane and endomembrane system, while others were associated with the nucleus and chloroplast (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S5</ref>).</p><p>To investigate the phylogenetic distribution and evolutionary relationships of the PERK gene family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using 50 BnPERK protein sequences and 15 AtPERK protein sequences by MEGA11 using the maximum likelihood (ML) method (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S6</ref>). The BnPERK genes were categorized into four groups (I-IV) based on sequence similarity and functional domain analysis. Group III, being the largest group, included 5 paralogs with 24 BnPERK genes. Group I followed, containing 6 paralogs with 21 BnPERK genes. Group II included 3 paralogs, with 3 BnPERK genes, while Group IV contained only 1 paralog, with 3 BnPERK genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). All AtPERK genes, with the exception of AtPERK2, exhibited a close syntenic association with the 50 BnPERK genes. Most AtPERK genes corresponded to 2-6 orthologous genes in B. napus, each comprising orthologous genes from both the A and C subgenomes of B. napus. Notably, AtPERK3 was associated with a single ortholog, BnPERK03A1, as its counterpart in the C subgenome appeared to have been lost. These results suggest that genome rearrangement and gene loss occurred during the polyploidization of B. napus.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Chromosomal Distribution and Collinearity Analysis of BnPERK Genes</head><p>The 50 BnPERK genes were evenly distributed across the A and C subgenomes of B. napus, with 25 genes in each (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> and Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>). These genes were dispersed among all chromosomes, except for A10. The highest concentration of genes was on the chromosome A1, which harbored seven genes, followed by six genes on C6 and five genes on A7. Single BnPERK genes were identified on chromosomes A2, A3, A4, A5, C4, and C9. The results indicated an irregular arrangement of the PERK gene family across the rapeseed chromosomes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p><p>The collinear gene pairs in the B. napus genome were analyzed to explore syntenic relationships among BnPERKs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). We identified 81 collinear gene pairs, including 49 pairs resulting from segmental duplication between the A and C subgenomes and 32 pairs occurring within a subgenome. The result indicated a high conservation between the A and C subgenomes. Additionally, we assessed the selective pressure exerted on duplicated BnPERK genes by calculating the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks) for the paralogous gene pairs (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>). The Ka/Ks ratios ranged from 0.1409 to 0.2518 for 17 gene pairs in the A subgenome and from 0.1682 to 0.2519 for 15 gene pairs in the C subgenome. Furthermore, the Ka/Ks ratios for 49 gene pairs between the A and C subgenomes varied from 0.0482 to 0.5148. Notably, the Ka/Ks ratios for all paralogous gene pairs were found to be less than 1, indicating purifying selection acting on BnPERK genes.

Protein-protein interaction network analysis supported this result, revealing the multifunctionality of BnPERK proteins and emphasizing their broad participation in plant physiological processes specific to plant disease response <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. The interactions involved cell wall organization, plant-pathogen interactions, plasma membrane dynamics, endomembrane activities, MAPK signaling pathways, and starch/sucrose metabolism. Given that pathogen-induced changes in cell walls affected disease resistance, it is possible that BnPERKs detect these alterations and initiate responses to maintain cell wall integrity <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. The membrane localization of BnPERKs suggested they might perceive infection signals at the cell's surface. Upon activation by cell wall components, BnPERKs likely trigger downstream signaling cascades, including MAPK pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Otherwise, MAPK pathways also acted as downstream signaling components of hormones and played important roles in plant responses to different stresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.

The parasite is dependent on plant-derived sugars as a carbon source for colonization <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. The enriched sugar metabolism reflects the altered homeostasis and increased demand for sugar in infected plants. However, the downstream signaling components and their regulation in response to P. brassicae infection are not yet clear. The PERK gene family, with its known functions in cell wall integrity and stress responses, may contribute to reinforcing the plant cell wall during pathogen infection or modulating defense-related signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Given the role of PERKs in disease response, the involvement of the PERK gene family in B. napus in clubroot disease was as expected. The transcriptional downregulation of BnPERK09A1, BnPERK09C1, Bn-PERK14A1, and BnPERK06C2 upon P. brassicae infection suggests their putative roles in clubroot disease response. In accordance with the result in B. napus, the expression of AtPERK9 was also downregulated in response to P. brassicae. The perk9 mutant was used for clubroot disease investigation, indicating the roles of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 in the disease resistance.

The induction of PR2 and RBOHD in both Col-0 and perk9 after inoculation suggested that basal immune response occurred in susceptible Col-0. Furthermore, the induction of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 by IAA treatment was also particularly intriguing, as IAA is known to act as a signaling molecule potentially involved in the response to P. brassicae infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The study emphasized the evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles of the BnPERK gene family. It suggested that BnPERK genes are involved in various physiological processes, including growth regulation, stress responses, and the defense against pathogens. The transcriptional downregulation of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 upon P. brassicae infection and the potential involvement of these genes in clubroot disease response further emphasize their significance in plant immunity. The identification of BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1 as potential targets for disease management strategies and their putative role in signaling networks could contribute to the resistance improvement of Brassicaceae crops.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
