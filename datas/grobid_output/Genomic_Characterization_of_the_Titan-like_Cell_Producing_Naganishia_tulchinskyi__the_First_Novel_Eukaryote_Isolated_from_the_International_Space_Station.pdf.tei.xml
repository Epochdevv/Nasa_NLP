			<abstract>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Multiple strains of a novel yeast belonging to genus Naganishia were isolated from environmental surfaces aboard the International Space Station (ISS). These strains exhibited a phenotype similar to Titan cell (~10 µm diameter) morphology when grown under a combination of simulated microgravity and 5% CO 2 conditions. Confocal, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy revealed distinct morphological differences between the microgravity-grown cells and the standard Earth gravity-grown cells, including larger cells and thicker cell walls, altered intracellular morphology, modifications to extracellular fimbriae, budding, and the shedding of bud scars. Phylogenetic analyses via multi-locus sequence typing indicated that these ISS strains represented a single species in the genus Naganishia and were clustered with Naganishia diffluens. The name Naganishia tulchinskyi is proposed to accommodate these strains, with IF6SW-B1 T as the holotype. The gene ontologies were assigned to the cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, suggesting a variety of phenotypes that are well suited to respond to microgravity and radiation. Genomic analyses also indicated that the extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were among the highest cellular component results, thus implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the highest molecular function matches included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The genus Naganishia <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> was resurrected from Cryptococcus and emended to accommodate the albidus clade of Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes, and Basidiomycota <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. The genus Naganishia contains the following species as legitimate in MycoBank: N. adeliensis, N. albida, N. albidosimilis, N. antarctica, N. bhutanensis, N. brisbanensis, N. cerealis, N. diffluens, N. friedmannii, N. globosa, N. indica, N. liquefaciens, N. nivalis, N. onofrii, N. qatarensis, N. randhawae, N. uzbekistanensis, N. vaughanmartiniae, and N. vishniacii <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. However, the addition of N. floricola made the list a total of 20 Naganishia species, but several of these members were yet to be validly described. In an ongoing Microbial Tracking experiment on the International Space Station (ISS), six yeast strains belonging to the family Tremellomycetes were isolated <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and whole-genome sequences (WGS) were generated <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Some of the Naganishia species that were phylogenetically related to these ISS strains, which were reported to be psychrophilic or psychrotolerant species, isolated from Antarctica <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, also reported that the ISS Naganishia species might also display properties related to cold adaptation and an increase in radiation resistance. In addition, Naganishia species were also isolated from a variety of ecosystems, such as water <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, tree trunk <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>, air <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, Alpine glaciers <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, cheese, cereals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>, and human specimens <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>Members of the Cryptococcus species, from which Naganishia species have recently been separated, were reported to possess unique virulence factors associated with the pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18]</ref>. The morphological transformation of normal Cryptococcus cells into giant (Titan) cells was one of the factors contributing to cryptococcosis (an inhalation acquired infection) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. It was also reported that titanization was unique to the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex, and not found in other budding basidiomycetous yeasts or in the ascomycetous yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, when grown under similar growth conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21]</ref>. However, occasional enlarged cells have been reported in Cryptococcus terreus. The ISS Naganishia strains exhibited Titan-like cells, a phenotype similar to the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, when the ISS isolates were grown under simulated microgravity conditions.</p><p>One of the objectives of this study was to characterize the Titan-like cells of the novel Naganishia species isolated from the ISS environment. The microscopy analyses revealed the presence of Titan-like giant cells with abnormal morphology when Naganishia species were subjected to several stressors, including a combination of hypoxic 5% CO 2 and simulated ISS microgravity conditions. The second objective of this study was to utilize WGS for annotation in order to aid in the identification of genetic determinants related to cold adaptation and radiation resistance in N. tulchinskyi. The third objective was to determine the phylogenetic novelty of the ISS Naganishia strains (n = 4) using microscopy and taxonomic affiliation based on multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses, which included a seven gene concatenated (ITS, LSU, SSU, CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1) phylogeny <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Sample Collection and Isolation of Microorganisms</head><p>During the flight experiments of Microbial Tracking-1, several surface samples (1 m 2 ) were collected from various ISS environmental locations. Previous publications had detailed sample collection, processing, and isolation of cultivable microorganisms from the ISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Briefly, internal ISS surface samples were collected using polyester wipes and then transported to Earth for processing. Samples were collected just prior to departure (within 5 days) and stored at 4 • C in the ISS, transported in cold packs (~4 • C) from ISS to the Earth, hand delivered at Long Beach, California after splash down, which were then carried in ice packs (~4 • C) during ground transportation, before storing at JPL at 4 • C for further processing. Total number of days for sample storage time from sample collection to processing was ~7 days. Unless otherwise stated, all reagents were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). The materials associated with the sampling wipes were placed in 200 mL of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.4) solution and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA), supplemented with chloramphenicol (100 µg/mL; v/v), to isolate fungi <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22]</ref>. Microbial colonies grown at 25 • C for 7 days were picked from the media plates, purified, and stored for further analyses. Based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing, six yeast strains were tentatively assigned to the genus Cryptococcus, and subsequent WGS characterization revealed that two strains were identified as Papiliotrema laurentii, while four strains belonged to a yet to be described Naganishia species <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, making this species the first known novel eukaryote to be isolated from the ISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Whole Genome Sequencing Analyses</head><p>The WGS used for the analyses were previously generated and published <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The WGS raw data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref> for high-quality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The number of filtered reads obtained were used for assembly with SPAdes 3.14.0 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref> genome assembler (k-mer size-32 to 72 bases) using default parameters. Genomic DNA sequences and predicted proteomes (where available) of all other strains used in this study were downloaded from NCBI, followed by comparative analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Phylogenetic Analyses</head><p>Among the 20 known Naganishia species, NCBI had ITS sequences available for all the species except N. indica. The gene sequences of all available strains were retrieved from NCBI, except for the four ISS strains, which were derived from their WGS during this study. Phylogenetic analyses based on individual genes (ITS, LSU, SSU, CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, TEF1) and MLST analyses (with the seven genes) were carried out with all available Naganishia species (n = 10). The individual gene sequences for all strains were first aligned separately using ClustalW, and for MLST, seven gene sequences for each strain were concatenated manually, aligned using ClusatalW, and used to generate a Maximum Likelihood Tree using MEGA 7.0.26 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.1.">Growth Conditions for Phenotypic Analyses under Different Conditions</head><p>Naganishia sp. IF6SW-B1 T was streaked on a Yeast extract-Peptone-Dextrose agar (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, and 1.5% agar) plate and incubated at 30 • C for 48 h. After 48 h of growth, colonies were resuspended in PBS, and the cells were enumerated using a hemocytometer. The cells were then inoculated at an initial density of 2 × 10 5 cells/mL in synthetic dextrose (SD) broth. Replicates (n = 3) of each yeast strain were grown under each condition tested. The cells were inoculated in three conditions; (a) the first set was inoculated in 5 mL of liquid media in a tube, incubated at 30 • C, and shaken at 150 rpm; (b) the second set was inoculated in 5 mL liquid media and incubated on a rotating platform in a CO 2 incubator (5% CO 2 ) at 30 • C; (c) the final set was grown in 10 mL of liquid media in a high aspect ratio vessels (HARV, Synthecon Inc., Houston, TX, USA) and mounted onto a vertical rotating device (at 30 rpm) to simulate microgravity conditions, these were placed in a CO 2 incubator (5% CO 2 ) at 30 • C. The CO 2 level of ISS habitat is ~10× more (~4000 ppm) than at Earth conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Additionally, Titan cells were observed under 5% CO 2 level in C. neoformans <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. Hence, morphological changes were characterized at this 5% CO 2 level. The autoclavable HARVs provided oxygenation via a flat, silicone rubber gas transfer membrane (Synthecon Inc.). The cultures were all incubated as described for 4 days, followed by cell pelleting for further analyses.</p><p>The biochemical and physiological characterizations were characterized by employing BioLog Yeast plates, as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>. Briefly, 4-days grown colonies in PDA plates were collected in sterile distilled water aseptically, and ~10 6 cells were transferred into the BioLog Yeast plates (BioLog Inc., Hayward, CA, USA) and incubated at 25 • C for 7 days. The change in coloration and oxidation/assimilation profiles of 94 different carbon sources were documented by visual examination. The clear positive and negatives were scored in 7 days incubation, and delayed reaction (weak) was documented by examining the tetrazolium violet color change after 14 days incubation. Further incubation and observation after 30 days period of time did not yield any difference in results compared to those that were observed at day 7.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.2.">Confocal Microscopy</head><p>Yeast cell samples grown under the three conditions described above were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for 15 min at 4 • C. These cells were gently pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 3500 rpm, and cells were rinsed 3× with sterile PBS. Subsequent processing steps were carried out in the dark, where samples were covered with aluminum foil and protected from the light. Cell pellets were resuspended in 15 µM Calcofluor White and incubated for 1 h at 37 • C. Samples were then rinsed and pelleted as previously mentioned but with distilled H 2 O. After the third rinse, samples were pelleted again, and the pellet was resuspended with 1 µM TO-PRO ® -3 (Fisher Scientific, Los Angeles, CA, USA) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were further rinsed and pelleted, as previously mentioned, using distilled H 2 O. The resuspended samples were filtered through a 0.2 µM 25 mm Isopore Membrane Filter (GTBP) using a filter manifold. This membrane was removed, placed on a microscope slide, and a drop of antifade was added to the top. A coverslip was placed, and then, the edges were sealed. The samples were viewed using a Zeiss LSM 880 upright laser scanning confocal microscope and an Alpha Plan-APOCHROMAT 63× lens (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Yeast cell size and cell wall thickness were analyzed using ImageJ <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.3.">Scanning Electron Microscopy</head><p>Yeast cells grown under various conditions were preserved using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Following the concentration, cells were immersed in a chilled 4% PFA and incubated at 4 • C for 10 min before the PFA was removed and washed in PBS buffer. Fixed cells were transferred into a 24-well plate, dehydrated in an isopropyl alcohol (IPA) series (50% to 100%), and stored at 4 • C. Samples were critically point dried in an Automegasamdri 915B critical point dryer (Tousimis, Rockville, MD, USA). Samples were attached to SEM stubs with carbon tape (Ted Pella Inc., Redding, CA, USA), followed by carbon coating with a Leica EM ACE600 Carbon Evaporator (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) to a thickness of ~12 nm. SEM analysis was performed with an FEI Quanta 200F (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.4.">Transmission Electron Microscopy</head><p>TEM was performed to examine cell wall thickness variations and analyze organelles' differences between the different environmental stressors (CO 2 and simulated microgravity) induced Titan-like cells and standard cells, grown under Earth gravity, with 5% CO 2 and without CO 2 . For TEM, yeast cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for at least one hour at 4 • C. Samples were rinsed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and immersed in 1% osmium tetroxide with 1.6% potassium ferricyanide in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer for 1 h. After rinsing, samples were polymerized at 60 • C for 24-48 h in silicon molds. Thick sections (200 nm) were cut, stained with toluidine blue, and used. Thin sections (70 nm) were collected onto formvar-coated 50 mesh copper grids. The grids were post-stained with 2% uranyl acetate, followed by Reynold's lead citrate. The sections were imaged using a Tecnai 12 120 kV TEM (FEI, Hillsboro, OR, USA) and data were recorded using an UltraScan 1000 with Digital Micrograph 3 software (Gatan Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA).</p></div>

Data for the transcriptome assembly (EST), protein sequences (protein), and repeat annotations (rm_gff) was provided. Additionally, the model_org was set to 'simple' to annotate simple repeats, and inference predictions of genes directly from ESTs and protein homology were set (est2genome = 1, protein2genome = 1).

For SNAP, we used models with an AED of 0.25 or better and a length of 50 or more amino acids. To train Augustus, we excised regions that contain mRNA annotations based on our initial MAKER run, with 1000 bp on each side, as described <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38]</ref>.</p><p>To run BUSCO, the Eukaryota set of conserved genes was used. The -m genome option was specified to provide regions that included more than just transcripts. The initial HMM model selected was Cryptococcus, which corresponded to the closest genus of Naganishia (augustus_species = cryptococcus). The long option was set to optimize self-training Augustus.</p><p>Following the BUSCO run, the second round of MAKER was performed using the SNAP and Augustus models. For this purpose, FASTA sequence files were replaced with GFF files (est_gff, protein_gff, and rm_gff), and est2genome and protein2genome were switched to 0. The third run of MAKER was performed, and the gene models were evaluated by counting the number of gene models and the gene lengths after each round and running BUSCO using the transcript sequences (-m transcriptome). ** Match &gt; 75% of the protein sequence and e-value &lt; 1 × 10 -25 ; * Match &lt; 75% of the protein sequence or e-value &gt; 1 × 10 -25 . </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Results and Discussion</head><p>Several yeast strains belonging to the Naganishia (Cryptococcus) diffluens clade of Filobasidiales were isolated from two different flight collection experiments conducted aboard the ISS <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. These strains, referred to as IF6SW-B1 T , IF7SW-B1, IF1SW-F1, and IIF5SW-F1, were isolated from four different ISS locations and identified to be novel species belonging to the genus Naganishia, based on genomic characterization via polyphasic taxonomic approaches. The sampling of ISS surfaces, performed for this study, took place within the US on-orbit segments. Sampling campaign (denoted as I) was carried out on 4 March 2015, and the second one (denoted as II) was conducted on 15 May 2015. Samples collected during this study were: Node 3 (Locations #1, #2, and #3), Node 1 (Locations #4 and #5), Permanent Multipurpose Module (Location #6), U.S. Laboratory (Location #7), and Node 2 (Locations #8 and control).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Phylogenetic Analyses of Novel ISS Strains</head><p>To confirm that these four ISS strains form a novel species, their phylogenetic affiliations were analyzed with other species belonging to the genus Naganishia. The MycoBank database documented 19 Naganishia species, and the CBS database showed only 11 Naganishia species. The gene sequences available on NCBI for Naganishia species (n = 10) were used to generate phylogenetic maximum likelihood trees with C. neoformans CBS 132 strain as an outgroup.</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region rRNA gene, D1/D2 domain of large subunit (LSU or 26S) rRNA gene, small subunit (SSU or 18S) rRNA gene, and housekeeping genes, including two subunits of RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2), translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1), and cytochrome b (CYTB), which were used for differentiating Tremellomycetes species <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. The respective gene sequences that were available on NCBI for different Naganishia species were included in the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, genomes of closely related members from Tremellomycetes (Goffeauzyma gastricus CBS 2288 (AF145323.1), Heterocephalacria arrabidensis CBS 8678 (AF444362.2), Piskurozyma cylindrica CBS 8680 (AF444360.1), Solicoccozyma aerius CBS155 (AF145324.1), and Tremella mesenterica CBS 6973 (AF444433.1)) were included with Cryptococcus neoformans CBS 132 (AF444326.1) as the outgroup.</p><p>Initially, seven individual phylogenetic trees using ITS, LSU, SSU, CTYB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1 genes were generated and are presented in Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1-S7</ref>. When tested individually, the phylogenetic analyses generated based on individual gene, formed a single group for all four ISS strains. There were no significant variations in ITS, LSU, and SSU gene sequences (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref>), whereas the other four genes (CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1) invariably exhibited higher resolution in differentiating all the Naganishia species. The ITS tree (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>) showed that the ISS strains were placed at the same position of the three recognized species, N. diffluens, N. liquefaciens and N. albidosimilis. ITS sequences of the four ISS isolates showed 100% similarity to the sequence of N. albidosimilis CBS 7711 T (AF145325), N. liquefaciens CBS 968 T (AF444345), and N. diffluens CBS 160 T (AF145330). However, ITS sequences of N. vishniacii CBS 7110 T shared 97.84% similarity (13 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145320.), N. uzbekistanensis CBS 8683 T had 97.55% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF444339), and N. adeliensis CBS 8351 T exhibited 97.34% similarity (14 bp difference to GenBank accession no. AF145328) with ISS isolates (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S1</ref>). In the LSU tree (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>), the four ISS strains were placed at the same position that phylogenetically distinguished from N. albida, N. adeliensis, N. vishniacii, and N. albidosimilis with low bootstrap support. Comparing the LSU sequences of these ISS strains with closely related species showed a 97.71% similarity to N. albida (type strain, CBS 142; 14 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075474), 96.41% similarity to N. albidosimilis (type strain, CBS 1926; 22 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF137601), 96.25% similarly to N. liquefaciens (type strain, CBS 968; 23 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF181515), and 95.92% similarity to N. diffluens (type strain, CBS 160; 25 different base pairs; GenBank accession no. AF075502) (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>). The taxonomic threshold predicted to discriminate basidiomycetous yeast species is 99.51% in the LSU region and 99.21% in the ITS region <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Hence, the sequence data and phylogenetic analysis of the LSU regions of the ISS isolates confirm they belong to a new species in the genus Naganishia (order Filobasidiales). The SSU tree (Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S3</ref>) demonstrated that these four strains were not separated from any of the recognized species.</p><p>The other phylogenetic trees based on CYTB, RPB1, RPB2, and TEF1 grouped the ISS strains together, and the closest neighbor was identified as N. diffluens. Subsequently, MLST was carried out by manually concatenating the seven genes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The MLST phylogenetic tree constructed showed the four ISS strains clustered together in the same clade with N. diffluens CBS 160 T (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The individual gene-based and MLST tree-based analyses both further supported the finding that the four ISS strains belong to the same species which is closely related to, but separate from, N. diffluens. This suggested that the four ISS strains were novel species of the genus Naganishia. All four strains were isolated during different flights and sampling sessions at various locations, suggesting that these isolates are not clonal but persisting in the ISS environment. The ecological significance of this finding, in the closed system aboard the ISS warrants, further study. The genomes of four ISS strains were sequenced, draft genome was assembled, annotated, and the results were published elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The genome size was ~19.4 Mbp with GC content between 53-56%, similar to other members of the genus Naganishia. phylogenetic tree constructed showed the four ISS strains clustered together in the same clade with N. diffluens CBS 160 T (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).

Further gene characterizations are required to understand the molecular mechanisms associated with adaptation of novel IF6SW-B1 T yeast to space conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20]</ref>.</p><p>While recent studies suggest that titanization is a rare phenomenon that occurs mostly in members of the C. neoformans/C. gattii species complex, the observation of Titan-like cells in ISS Naganishia species is novel. Understanding how microgravity influences this process is important to predict the emergence of virulence in Naganishia species and develop novel antifungal drugs. These antifungal drugs can be developed to inhibit the phenotypic transitions associated with fungal pathogenicity, especially since these strains were isolated across longitudinal sampling sessions of the ISS and appear persistent. Titanization and the increasing of cell size has been shown to aide Cryptococcus cells evade the immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[66]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[67]</ref>. By growing from the normal range of ~1 to 3 µm in diameter to &gt;10 µm, Titan cells cannot be readily ingested by phagocytic cells and, thus, persist in host tissue. Moreover, our data show that Titan-like cells are more likely to survive and produce offspring, when confronted by multiple environmental stress conditions, than typical cells. Additionally, their normally sized offspring maintained an advantage over regular cells in continued exposure to stress. Titan-like cell progeny's increased survival and genomic diversity might promote rapid adaptation to new or high-stress space conditions; however, more research is needed to confirm this aspect.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Genomic Analyses of the Novel ISS Strain</head><p>Using BLAST, genes in ISS Naganishia species were compared to known genes that conferred resistance to cold, microgravity, and radiation (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), as well as pigment biosynthesis. The reference genes were a compilation of NCBI queries and previously reported genes related to the spaceflight-related characteristics (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). In addition to our four N. tulchinskyi strains, N. vishniacii (Antarctica strain), Papiliotrema laurentii (ISS isolates), and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (space flown strain) were included for comparison. A total of 24 genes aligned to one or more of the assemblies.

In total, 4894 protein-coding genes were predicted from the assembled draft genomes, which comprised 128 scaffolds (Supplemental Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>). A total of 86, 47, and 89 top ontological hits were assigned, respectively, for Biological Process, Cellular Component, and Molecular Function (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">S1</ref>), ranked by ontological uniqueness of term with respect to all other terms cataloged in UniProt. Top Biological Processes include cell morphogenesis, microtubule-based response, and response to UV light, reflecting a repertoire that was suited to respond to microgravity and radiation (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>). The extracellular region, outer membrane, and cell wall were top cellular component results, implying a set of genes associated with Titan-like cell plasticity. Finally, the top molecular function hits included cytoskeletal motor activity, microtubule motor activity, and nuclear export signal receptor activity. Changing these molecular mechanisms can alter the shape of cells, and in fungi, morphological changes in response to environmental stimuli have been reported and mostly attributed to pathogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">69]</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Conclusions</head><p>In summary, a novel yeast, N. tulchinskyi, was isolated from the ISS environmental surfaces that produced giant Titan-like cells under simulated microgravity conditions. Morphological characterization of N. tulchinskyi cells revealed that the cell wall is thicker under simulated microgravity and might help them withstand such unfavorable conditions, and these simulated microgravity-grown cells demonstrate a novel bud scar shedding trait. The phylogenetic analyses using the MLST approach showed that these are novel yeast. Further genomic characterization revealed genes responsible for cell morphogenesis and UVC resistance, reflecting a range of molecular mechanisms suited to respond to microgravity and radiation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
