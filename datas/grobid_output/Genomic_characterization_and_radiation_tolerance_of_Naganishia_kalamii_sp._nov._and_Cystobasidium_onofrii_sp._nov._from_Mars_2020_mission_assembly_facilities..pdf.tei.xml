<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>During the construction and assembly of the Mars 2020 mission components at two different NASA cleanrooms, several fungal strains were isolated. Based on their colony morphology, two strains that showed yeast-like appearance were further characterized for their phylogenetic position. The species-level classification of these two novel strains, using traditional colony and cell morphology methods combined with the phylogenetic reconstructions using multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) based on several gene loci (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB and TEF1), and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was carried out. This polyphasic taxonomic approach supported the conclusion that the two basidiomycetous yeasts belong to hitherto undescribed species. The strain FJI-L2-BK-P3 T , isolated from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility, was placed in the Naganishia albida clade (Filobasidiales, Tremellomycetes), but is genetically and physiologically different from other members of the clade. Another yeast strain FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T , isolated from the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility, was placed in the genus Cystobasidium (Cystobasidiales, Cystobasidiomycetes) and is distantly related to C. benthicum. Here we propose two novel species with the type strains, Naganishia kalamii sp. nov. (FJI-L2-BK-P3 T = NRRL 64466 = DSM 115730) and Cystobasidium onofrii sp. nov. (FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T = NRRL 64426 = DSM 114625). The phylogenetic analyses revealed that single gene phylogenies (ITS or LSU) were not conclusive, and MLSA and WGS-based phylogenies were more advantageous for species discrimination in the two genera. The genomic analysis predicted proteins associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response and the presence of genes that are directly related to osmotolerance and psychrotolerance in both novel yeasts described. Cells of these two newly-described yeasts were exposed to UV-C radiation and compared with N. onofrii, an extremophilic UV-C resistant cold-adapted Alpine yeast. Both novel species were UV resistant, emphasizing the need for collecting and characterizing extremotolerant microbes, including yeasts, to improve microbial reduction techniques used in NASA planetary protection programs.</p></div>

Yeasts and yeast-like fungi isolated from Antarctic environments (proposed as resembling the surface and conditions of Mars and/or Icy Moons) were reported to successfully resist a wide spectrum of stressors which mimic conditions on other planetary bodies, including ionizing radiation, UV-flux irradiation, extremely low and high temperatures, desiccation, high salinity and acidic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Onofri et al. 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Onofri et al. , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">Selbmann et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Pacelli et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Pacelli et al. , 2021;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Buzzini et al. 2018)</ref>.

However, the presence of fungi in these cleanrooms has also recently been assessed, since fungi are tolerant of a wide range of extreme conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Parker et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blachowicz et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chander et al. 2022b</ref>). Characterization of fungi (including yeast) is important both for assessing the risk of forward contamination and updating appropriate cleaning and sterilization strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Benardini and Moissl-Eichinger 2022)</ref>. Therefore, newly discovered fungal (including yeasts) species in cleanrooms must be evaluated not only for their morphology, but also at the genomic level so that new countermeasures can be developed to eradicate them based on their biology and resilient properties <ref type="bibr">(Chander et al. 2022b)</ref>.</p><p>To date, only filamentous fungi have been described from cleanrooms <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Parker et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blachowicz et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chander et al. 2022b)</ref>. In contrast to filamentous fungi, yeasts are microscopic and predominantly unicellular <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Boekhout et al. 2021)</ref>. It has been shown that yeast and yeast-like fungi are capable of adapting to and colonizing various ecological niches due to their genetic and phenotypic plasticity and robustness <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ene et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Ribeiro et al. 2022)</ref>. Several important adaptations facilitate survival of yeast cells in harsh environments, including production of thick external polysaccharide capsules, forming biofilm, and UV protective compounds, melanin, carotenoids and mycosporines <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Buzzini et al. 2018)</ref>. In this study, we describe for the first time two novel yeast species from NASA cleanrooms, which are oligotrophic extreme environments.</p><p>To explore yeast diversity in various environments including NASA cleanrooms, understanding their phylogenetic diversity and ecology is necessary. Phylogenies based on 16S ribosomal RNA or average nucleotide identity (ANI) are most commonly used for prokaryote taxonomy, but fungal species are identified with nucleotide sequences of multiple conserved gene regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Lücking et al. 2021</ref>). To identify yeasts, both phenotypic traits and molecular analyses are required <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Boekhout et al. 2021)</ref>. The modern yeast taxonomy includes genealogical approaches based on single locus (ITS or LSU), multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and recently whole genome sequencing (WGS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Libkind et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Boekhout et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chander et al. 2022b</ref>). Molecular phylogeny for species recognition in Fungi is gaining broad attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Lücking et al. 2021</ref>), but understanding species ecology requires investigating morphology, physiology, and biochemistry leading to the Consolidated Species Concept based on the so-called polyphasic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Boekhout et al. 2021)</ref>.</p><p>One of the objectives of this study was to characterize two novel yeast species by employing the polyphasic taxonomic approach, which is necessary to formally describe the two novel taxa. Colony morphology, microscopic features, and physiological properties were combined with MLSA phylogeny (seven loci). In addition, a phylogenetic analysis based on available WGS was applied to test its utility for species discrimination. The assembled and characterized genomes of Naganishia kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3 T and Cystobasidium onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T were compared with genomes of other closely related species to identify unique and shared evolutionary characters. Considering unique properties of the habitat challenging the microbial life, the third objective of this study was to assess the UV-C resistance of the two novel yeast species and compared with a UV-C resistant extremophilic yeast, Naganishia onofrii strain DBVPG 5303 from Miage glacier (Mont Blanc, Alps, Italy) at the altitude of 3892 m above sea level <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Turchetti et al. 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Sample collection and isolation of yeasts</head><p>Steps for sample collection and isolation of yeasts at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Spacecraft Assembly Facility (JPL-SAF) and the Kennedy Space Center Payload Hazardous and Servicing Facility (KSC-PHSF) cleanrooms were previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Parker et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blachowicz et al. 2022)</ref>. Briefly, samples were collected from cleanroom surfaces using moist polyester wipes and were agitated in 200 mL sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and shaken for 1 min. The resulting PBS suspension was concentrated using an Innova Prep LLC concentrating pipette and spread onto plates containing potato dextrose agar (PDA, Difco, #213,400) mixed with chloramphenicol (25 µg/mL). Plates were incubated at 25 °C for 7-14 days, and yeast strains were isolated, purified, and stored for further characterization.</p><p>Steps for determination of microscopic traits and observation and microscopic morphology were followed as per previous protocol <ref type="bibr">(Chander et al. 2022b</ref>). In a nutshell, a small block of agar was placed in the center of a sterile slide, and all four sides of the agar were inoculated with the yeast suspension. Subsequently, a sterile cover slip was gently placed on top of the agar block. The slide culture was kept in a moist Petri dish lined with filter paper soaked in sterile water. After 14-21 days, the yeast grew out onto the coverslip and the slide was tested. The cover slip was gently removed with sterile forceps and placed on a clean microscopic slide with a drop of water or lactophenol cotton blue (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA) for microscopic observations. Phase contrast images were captured on an Olympus BX53 microscope with an Olympus DP25 camera and Olympus cellSens software. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images were generated on a Nikon Ti2-E inverted microscope with Nikon NIS Elements software. Cell morphological characters were measured with the Olympus cellSens or Nikon NIS Elements software.</p><p>Assimilation tests were performed in liquid media following the procedures described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Kurtzman et al. 2011)</ref>, in custom-made microplates (Nunc 96-Well U-Bottom plate, Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 5 mL tubes (Falcon, Corning) using the same standard set of substrates and with YT MicroPlates (BioLog) as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Greetham et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Mašínová et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">Passer et al. 2019)</ref>. Tubes and microplates with suitable aliquots of test cultures were incubated at 25 °C. Utilization of substrates was examined in PDA and incubated for 7 days. The change in coloration and oxidation and/or assimilation profiles of 94 different carbon sources were documented by visual examination. The clear positives and negatives were scored within 7 days of incubation, and delayed reaction (weak) was documented by examining the tetrazolium violet color change after 14 days of incubation. Further incubation and observation on 14th day did not yield any difference in results compared to those that were observed at day 7. Tubes were examined after 7, 14 and 21 days, and the growth (changing turbidity) was documented by visual examination.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Whole genome sequencing</head><p>Genomic DNA was isolated from 1 g wet biomass scraped from PDA plates, using a ZymoBIOMICS Mag-Bead DNA kit (Zymo Research) and bead beating, followed by a Precellys homogenizer (Bertin) treatment. The quality of genomic DNA was verified by gel electrophoresis and quantified by spectrophotometric measurements (Nanophotometer NP80 Mobile, Implen GmbH). Library preparation was performed using the Illumina Nextera Flex Protocol (Illumina document # 1000000025416 v07). The initial amount of DNA for library preparation was quantified, and 5-12 cycles of PCR amplification were carried out to normalize the output depending on the input DNA concentration. The amplified genomic DNA fragments were indexed and pooled in a 384-plex configuration with dual-index adapters. WGS was performed on a NovaSeq 6000 S4 flowcell PE 2 × 150 base pairs (bp) platform with a paired-end module. The data was filtered with NGS QC Toolkit v2.3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(Patel and Jain 2012)</ref>, for highquality (HQ) vector and adaptor-free reads for genome assembly (cutoff read length for HQ, 80%; cutoff quality score, 20). The genomes for the two novel yeast species were reassembled using the Automatic Assembly For The Fungi (AAFTF v 0.3.3) pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(Stajich and Palmer 2019</ref>), as follows: (i)The Illumina sequencing reads underwent trimming via the BBDuk module within the BBMap software suite (v 38.95) (BBMap: A Fast, Accurate, Splice-Aware Aligner (Conference) OSTI.GOV); (ii) BBMap was employed to eliminate any contaminant reads, and (iii) the resulting high-quality reads were assembled using SPAdes v3.15.4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bankevich et al. 2012)</ref>.

The gene sequences of all available Naganishia strains were retrieved from NCBI, except for N. tulchinskyi <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bijlani et al. 2022</ref>) and FJI-L2-BK-P3 T strains, which were obtained from using blast tools (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Likewise, the gene sequence of all available Cystobasidium strains were retrieved from NCBI, except for the FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T strain, which was obtained from its WGS during this study (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S2</ref>). Phylogenetic analyses were carried out using seven genes (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1, RPB2, CYTB, and TEF1) with all available Naganishia (n = 20) and Cystobasidium species (n = 21). The individual gene sequences for Cystobasidium and Naganishia datasets were aligned separately using the R package DECIPHER <ref type="bibr" target="#b103">(Wright 2020)</ref>. Briefly, sequences from a fasta file were extracted and loaded using ReadDNAStringSet function. The removeGaps argument was set to "all" to remove all gaps in the input sequences. For this reason, Orient-Nucleotides function was used to reorient sequences by changing their directionality and/or complementarity to match specified reference sequences in the same set. By default, the first sequence with maximum width was used as a reference sequence. Character string indicating the allowed reorientation of non-reference sequences was set to "both" (for reverse complement). The algorithm works by finding the k-mer distance between the reference sequence. The more the sequences look similar, smaller is the evolutionary distance. Numeric threshold giving the decrease in k-mer distance required to adopt the alternative orientation was set to 0.05. AlignSeqs function was performed for the generation of the alignment. The profile-to-profile method aligns a sequence set by merging profiles along a guide tree until all the input sequences are aligned. Guide tree was automatically constructed based on a distance matrix of shared k-mers using the setting guideTree = NULL. iterations = 2 and refinement = 1 were set to specify the number of iteration steps to regenerate the guide tree based and the re-alignment. Thus, the best alignment was chosen based on its sum-of-pairs score. Construction of phylogenetic trees utilizing the seven gene sequences listed above for MLSA was performed via IQ-TREE v 2.1.1 using the concatenation approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Minh et al. 2020)</ref>. ModelFinder approach was used for the evaluation of the best DNA substitution model <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Kalyaanamoorthy et al. 2017)</ref>. Ultrafast bootstraps and SH-like approximate likelihood ratio test (SH-aLRT) were assumed for branch support <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anisimova et al. 2011)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Molecular phylogeny</head><p>Naganishia kalamii belongs to Basidiomycota, class Tremellomycetes, and order Filobasidiales. ITS sequence similarity of the strain FJI-L2-BK-P3 T with the majority of Naganishia species was &gt; 98.5% suggesting that the ITS marker alone may not be useful to identify Naganishia species (see also <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Scorzetti et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fonseca et al. 2011)</ref>. Furthermore, combined sequence analyses of both ITS and LSU fragments placed N. kalamii in the N. albida clade, in a distinct position next to N. albida var. ovalis CBS 5810 T (two substitutions in the LSU). Although the N. albida clade is represented in the literature, collections and databases by an array of strains showing highly variable physiological and biochemical characteristics, the pair-wise distances matrix clearly shows the difficulties to discriminate the members of N. albida clade when only ITS and LSU markers were used (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S2</ref>). This problem was highlighted in the comments to the species by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Fonseca et al. (2011)</ref>, but in 2021 two Naganishia species were described largely based on sequence dissimilarity in the clade <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Kachalkin et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tan et al. 2021</ref>). However, it is important to note that the analyzed protein-coding (CYTB, TEF1, RPB1 and RPB2) individual phylogenetic trees of gene fragments other than SSU (invariable for the whole clade), LSU and ITS exhibited higher resolution in differentiating the Naganishia species (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3-S7</ref>). Furthermore, seven-loci phylogenetic tree (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>) convincingly showed that FJI-L2-BK-P3 T occupies a distinct position in the clade with high bootstrap support (100%). The novel species N. kalamii is most closely related to N. albida var. ovalis CBS 5810 T , N. albida var. kuetzingii CBS 1926 T (type of Cryptococcus kuetzingii), N. albida var. albida CBS 142 T , N. liquefaciens CBS 968 T and N. adeliensis CBS 8351 T (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>). Another species N. nivalis was not included in the MLSA-analysis because proteincoding sequences were not available for the analysis. The tree based on conserved genes from the N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3 T genome (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>) showed that N. kalamii is phylogenetically distinct from N. albida var. albida CBS 142 T and Naganishia sp. NRRL Y-1402 that was earlier misidentified as N. albida var. albida.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genomic characteristics of N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3 T and comparative genomic analysis</head><p>The estimated genome size of N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3 T is 27.86 Mb and assembled into 478 scaffolds (N50 = 190,774, L50 = 38) with a largest scaffold as 1,000,601 bp. The GC content is 53.9% and the raw sequences are submitted with an accession #: JAK-LLX000000000. A total of 8,085 genes were identified, divided into 7902 mRNAs and 183 tRNAs. We have found 1,904 GO annotated and 6007 Eggnog terms, 2548 Interpro and 4783 Pfam domains, 177 CAZYmes, 219 MEROPS peptidases, 396 secreted proteins, and 1624 BUSCO orthologs. When compared with other Naganishia species, N. kalamii has the highest number of genes (8085) and 7902 proteins products (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S4</ref>). Among the seven species of Naganishia analyzed, three species belonging to the N. albida clade (N. kalamii, N. albida JCM 2334 and NRRL Y-1402) had similar number of predicted genes and proteins, of which N. kalamii exhibited the highest number of secreted proteins (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>) as well the number of peptidases (MEROPS; Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>) but not CAZymes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Lowest numbers of CAZymes terms were seen in Naganishia sp. N6 (168; deep sea isolate) and N. vishniacii ANT03-052 (170; Antarctic soil isolate), that were isolated from natural extreme environments.</p><p>Based on the detailed research in the MEROPS peptide database, 219 different membrane associated peptidases were identified within the families: aspartic (10), cycteine (52), metallo (76), serine (62), threonine (17) and protease inhibitors (2). Serine peptidase, S9 prolyl oligopeptidase (S09X subfamily), and the prolyl aminopeptidases (S33) were the most abundant families detected in the Naganishia species. Moreover, the metallo protease thimet oligopeptidase (M03A), pitrilysin (M16A), aminopeptidase N (M01) and the serine protease d-Ala-d-Ala carboxypeptidase B (S12) were found to be overrepresented in the genome of N. kalamii (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</p><p>Detailed analysis into CAZy database revealed 49 genes associated with assembly (GT: glycosyltransferase) and 109 (84 GH: glycoside hydrolase, 3 PL: polysaccharide lyase, 22 CE: carbohydrate esterase) involved in the breakdown of carbohydrate complexes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). In addition, 16 genes coding for initial lignin degradation (AA: auxiliary activities) and 5 involved in carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) were also predicted. According to genome-wide comparison, N. kalamii shared 59 CAZy families with other Naganishia species analyzed. No unique CAZy families have been recorded for N. kalamii. However, the polysaccharide lyase family 36 (PL36) was shared only among the members of the N. albida clade. GH5 and CE10 were the largest family (both with 15 predicted genes in N. kalamii) shared also by the other Naganishia members. GH5 consisted of genes related to cellulolytic activity while genes encoding CE10 family members act on non-carbohydrate substrates. Genes involved in the degradation of endogenous fungal cell wall polysaccharides (GH128) and lignin (AA1) were also detected.</p><p>Since survival of yeasts on UV-C exposure was performed during this study, Pfam and Interpro terms associated with dehydration, desiccation, rehydration and UV resistance have been investigated (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>). Results did not reveal significant differences in Pfam terms among the Naganishia species analyzed. Protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase (PF07714), WD domain, G-beta repeat (PF00400), Ras family (PF00071), Cytochrome P450 (PF00067), Ankyrin repeats (PF12796) and ABC transporter (PF00005) were the most presented Pfam terms in all the species. Heat shock protein 70 and dehydration stress-response Pfam terms were also commonly present in all the species analyzed. The psychrophilic  <ref type="table">S1</ref>. b WGS Maximum likelihood phylogeny of Naganishia kalamii reconstructed using a concatenated alignment of universally distributed yeast genes. Branch fidelity used two different approaches, Ultrafast bootstraps and Gene Concordance Factors, which were added next to its corresponding branches N. vishniacii ANT03-052 showed presence of genes involved in raffinose synthesis (PF05691).</p><p>The Interpro analysis filtered for UV resistance terms for N. kalamii showed the absence of protein directly involved in the synthesis of carotenoids (IPR004294). N. kalamii also lack the UV radiation resistance protein (IPR018791), short coiled -coil protein (IPR019357), and the XPG conserved site (IPR019974) involved in the catalytic mechanism of DNA excision repair, but XPG, N-terminal (IPR006085) and XPG/Rad2 endonuclease (IPR006084) are present, both not conserved residues. The only strain exhibiting all the terms involved in the UV resistance was Antarctic N. vishniacii ANT03-052 strain.</p><p>The profile of fungal-specific transcriptional factors was compared among the Naganishia species (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>). Fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain (IPR001138), fungal-specific TF domain (IPR007219), basic region leucine zipper 2 (IPR004827) and bZIP TF 1 (IPR004827) were commonly enriched in all the species considered. However, it was not prominent in N. kalamii when compared to the Antarctic strain N. vishniacii ANT03-052 and avian guano in South Africa strain N. randhawae eABCC1.</p><p>CAFE5 analysis revealed that N. kalamii has experienced an expansion of 10 Interpro domain categories while a reduction of 43 Interpro domains (p &lt; 0.05) was witnessed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>). The GO term conversion of the acquired Interpro domains are related to protein N-linked glycosylation and inositol phosphate dephosphorylation biological processes. In contrary, the contracted GO terms are related to regulation of DNAtemplated transcription, regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II, protein folding, proteolysis, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process, intracellular protein transport and vesicle-mediated transport. This suggested that N. kalamii have lost domains related to the control of transcription as well as protein degradation, folding and transport.</p><p>Six biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) were predicted in the genome of N. kalamii FJI-L2-BK-P3 T , five of which do not match with any known BGCs. These included three non-ribosomal peptide synthase-like (NRPS-like) clusters, one cluster encoding for a Type III polyketide synthase, and two clusters encoding for terpene synthesis, one of which was identified as the BGC for the synthesis of clavaric acid. Similar sets of BGCs were predicted for the genomes of Naganishia sp. strain N6 and N. albida JCM 2334, with two differences: one, neither of the terpene synthesis clusters were a match for clavaric acid in the genome of N. albida JCM 2334; and two, Naganishia sp. strain N6 was predicted to have a NRPS cluster in place of one of the three NRPS-like clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p></div>

The GC content is 48.8% and the raw sequences were submitted with an Accession#: JAKLNA000000000. The final annotation of the C. onofrii yielded a total of 6889 genes, divided into 6831 mRNAs and 58 tRNAs. The genome annotation revealed 2934 GO and 5820 Eggnog terms, 3930 Interpro and 4803 Pfam domains, 172 CAZYmes, 221 MEROPS peptidases, 335 secreted proteins, and 1540 BUSCO orthologs.</p><p>Comparative genome analyses of Cystobasidium species showed that C. onofrii has the second highest number of genes (6889) and predicted protein products (6831) after C. slooffiae (Additional file 1: Table <ref type="table">S7</ref>). The genomic annotations revealed that C. onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T secreted larger number of proteins and second to C. slooffiae among the Cystobasidium species (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S19</ref>). Similar trend is observed for the number of secreted proteins that are peptidases (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S20</ref>), CAZymes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>), and MEROPS classes. However, no significant changes in the number of each group have been observed. Among the CAZymes of C. onofrii, 30 genes associated with assembly of glycosyltransferase (GT) and 87 genes involved in the breakdown of carbohydrate complexes (52 GH: glycoside hydrolase, 5 PL: polysaccharide lyase, 30 CE: carbohydrate esterase) were predicted. In addition, 20 genes coding for initial lignin degradation (AA: auxiliary activities) and 1 involved in carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) were also noticed.</p><p>According to genome-wide comparison, C. onofrii shared 52 CAZy families with the other 4 Cystobasidium species while PL Family 36 (PL36) was unique in C. onofrii (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref>). GH5 and CE10 were the largest family (both with 16 predicted genes in C. onofrii) shared also by the other Cystobasidium members. GH5 presents genes related to the degradation of cellulose while genes encoding CE10 family members act on non-carbohydrate substrates. CE family 16 is another family well represented in C. onofrii along with C. tubakii and C. slooffiae.</p><p>Since C. onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T strain could utilize several organic substrates, a search in the MEROPS peptide database was performed in order to survey the genome for membrane associated peptidases that could initiate the degradation of complex protein molecules. In total, 221 different peptidases were identified, which were classified within the families: aspartic (13), cycteine (48), metallo (68), serine (76), threonine (19), protease inhibitors (2) and mixed peptidase (1). Serine and metallo peptidase are the predominant families in all the Cystobasidium species. In C. onofrii S9 prolyl oligopeptidase (S09X subfamily) and the prolyl aminopeptidases (S33) are the more abundant terms. S33 includes some hydrolases, which additionally degrade other substrates like lipids. The exo-keratinolytic enzymes M38 and the A01A subfamily members, are found abundantly in C. onofrii compare to the other Cystobasidium species (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S20</ref>).  <ref type="table">S2</ref>. b WGS Maximum likelihood phylogeny of Cystobasidium onofrii reconstructed using a concatenated alignment of universally distributed yeast genes. Branch fidelity used two different approaches, Ultrafast bootstraps and Gene Concordance Factors, which were added next to its corresponding branches Pfam and Interpro terms associated with dehydration, desiccation, rehydration and UV resistance have been investigated as stress parameters (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S21</ref>). Results did not reveal significant differences in Pfam terms among the Cystobasidium analyzed. Protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinase (PF07714), WD domain, G-beta repeat (PF00400), Ras family (PF00071), Cytochrome P450 (PF00067), Ankyrin repeats (3 copies) (PF12796) and ABC transporter (PF00005) are the most presented Pfam terms in all the species.</p><p>Heat shock protein 70 and other Pfam terms for predicted proteins involved in the dehydration stress-response are also commonly present in all the Cystobasidium species analyzed. The Interpro analysis filtered for UV resistance terms, seen in the genome of C. onofrii of proteins related to the synthesis of carotenoids (IPR004294; IPR002060) and DNA-repair (eg. IPR006084). However, C. onofrii lacks the UV radiation resistance protein (IPR018791) and short coiled protein (IPR019357) but both of these proteins are present in the genome of the Antarctic C. ongulense and in C. slooffiae (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S21</ref>).</p><p>Fungal-specific transcriptional factors among the Cystobasidium species (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S22</ref>) showed presence of Fungal Zn(2)-Cys(6) binuclear cluster domain (IPR001138), Fungal-specific TF domain (IPR007219), Basic region leucine zipper 2 (IPR004827), and bZIP TF 1 (IPR004827) and are more prominent in C. onofrii (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">S22</ref>), when compared with the strains isolated from natural extreme environments (Antarctic soil and deep sea).</p><p>Data from CAFE analysis of Cystobasidium species showed that C. onofrii has experienced an expansion of 31 Interpro domain categories while a reduction of 9 Interpro domains (p &lt; 0.05) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>). The expansions were related to acetyl-CoA biosynthetic process from pyruvate, DNA repair, regulation of DNA-templated transcription, protein phosphorylation, nitrogen compound metabolic process, mono-atomic ion transport, phospholipid biosynthetic process, iron ion transmembrane transport, and positive regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II. In contrary, the contracted GO terms were related to DNA repair, sulfate transport, and transmembrane transport.</p><p>A single BGC, an NRPS-like cluster of unknown function, was predicted in the genome of C. onofrii FKI-L6-BK-PAB1 T . The genomes of neighboring species C. tubakii JCM 31526 T and C. pallidum JCM 3780 T also contained a single NRPS-like cluster, with an additional unknown cluster encoding for terpene synthesis predicted for the genome of C. pallidum JCM 3780 T . The genome of C. benthicum was not available for comparison.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Resistance to UV irradiation of the novel yeasts</head><p>Survival rates of two novel species and the high-altitude cold-adapted N. onofrii exposed to UV-C are presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>. The cultivability of all three yeasts dramatically decreased due to desiccation before exposing them UV-C irradiation conditions (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S23</ref>). The survival of yeasts after desiccation was 22% for N. kalamii, 23% for C. onofrii, and 33% for N. onofrii. This observed trend might be not only due to the desiccation but also the effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) that was used to peel off the dried cells could not be ruled out. The number of cultivable cells after desiccation and PVA treatment were considered as baseline (N 0 ) while calculating the effect of different doses of radiation (N).</p><p>In general, all three yeasts displayed a similar resistance pattern up to 2000 J/m 2 with a gradual increase of mortality recorded with increasing radiation doses (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). Among the three yeasts tested, only N. onofrii exhibited higher resistance (~ 5.5 × 10 3 CFU at 2000 J/m 2 and ~ 4.7 × 10 3 CFU at 3000 J/m 2 [p &lt; 0.05], with 72% of conidia were cultivable after exposure to the highest dosage [3000 J/m 2 ]). Even though C. onofrii (~ 2.1 × 10 3 CFU) and N. kalamii (~ 2.9 × 10 3 CFU) exhibited a linear decrease in cultivability up to 2000 J/m 2 , a significant decrease in viability was noticed at the 3000 J/m 2 dosage for both C. onofrii (~ 5.6 × 10 2 CFU; p &lt; 0.05; Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S23</ref>) and N. kalamii (~ 1.2 × 10 2 CFU; p &lt; 0.005; Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S24</ref>). The pink-colored C. onofrii retained 27% of the cultivability after UV-C radiation exposure whereas the non-pigmented N. kalamii was the most sensitive, with only 13% of cultivable cells present after 3000 J/m 2 of UV-C irradiation. Exposure experiments were repeated twice and showed the same trends.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Microorganisms associated with NASA spacecraft assembly cleanrooms might hitchhike on spacecraft surfaces, contaminate extraterrestrial environments, or compromise the life-detection missions. Due to stringent maintenance and cleaning, SAFs can be considered as extreme environments since microorganisms found in these cleanrooms could withstand unfavorable conditions and survive low nutrient availability, desiccation, controlled temperature, etc. Indeed, bacteria and fungi isolated from these SAFs are poly-resistant and have been reported to withstand harsh and unfavorable conditions. Therefore, characterization of yeast species from NASA spacecraft assembly cleanrooms is essential.</p><p>The identification of yeasts has been shifted from phenotypic characterization to sequence-based identification and DNA-markers were utilized for defining their phylogenetic affiliation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Fonseca et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Scorzetti et al. 2002)</ref>. Since the 2000s, Naganishia species have been identified by considering differences among ribosomal gene sequences (ITS and partial LSU), which sometimes leads to ambiguous identification in subsequent revisions of the genus <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Turchetti et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ruiz and Radwan 2021)</ref>. Circumscription of the species Cryptococcus albidus has a long and complicated history of splitting and lumping using the ever-growing array of available tests and tools, including whole-cell protein patterns, DNA-DNA hybridization, and nucleotide sequencing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fonseca et al. 2011)</ref>. The species has long been known as a variable species and included, as varieties, yeasts that are presently placed in other genera and families of Filobasidiales <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fonseca et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Liu et al. 2015)</ref>. As the result of reclassification of the C. albidus species complex using LSU and later ITS sequences, many previous varieties were promoted to the taxonomic level of species, e.g. Naganishia diffluens, N. globosa, N. liquefaciens, Solicoccozyma terrea, Solicoccozyma terricola. Delineation of species using a single ribosomal gene region is not always reliable in basidiomycetous yeasts, because different lineages strongly vary in their rates of nucleotide substitution <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Fell et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Scorzetti et al. 2002)</ref>. The case of the genus Naganishia is challenging as species were delimited based on very few substitutions in the two fragments, ITS and LSU. Based on ITS and LSU, the albida clade of the genus Naganishia currently include three varieties of N. albida (N. albida var. albida CBS Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> Survivability of various yeasts exposed to UV-C radiation (doses: 0, 500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 J/m 2 .

The ratio of survival rates from three different species are plotted. The gray box shows the effect of desiccation and PVA treatment. The experiments were repeated twice 142 T , N. albida var. kuetzingii CBS 1926 T (formerly Cryptococcus kuetzingii), N. albida var. ovalis CBS 5810 T ) and three other species (N. nivalis DBVPG 5706 T , N. liquefaciens CBS 968 T , N. brisbanensis BRIP 28244; Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Scorzetti et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Kurtzman et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Li et al. 2020)</ref>. However, according to our results, combined sequence analysis of the LSU and ITS sequences, it not possible to differentiate members of N. albida clade using the approach due to low discriminatory power and lack of bootstrap support (Additional file 2: Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). Our results suggest that the recently described N. brisbanensis <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Tan et al. 2021</ref>) might be a taxonomic synonym of Cryptococcus kuetzingii, the species that have not been included in the original analysis by <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Tan et al. (2021)</ref>. To improve as much as possible poor species resolution in the ITS-LSU tree, a seven-loci (MLSA) and WGS-based phylogenies were generated for the discrimination of N. albida clade members. The MLSA tree convincingly separated N. kalamii from the other members of the N. albida clade suggesting that it should be placed in a new species rather than keeping as a N. albida variety which would further increasing the heterogeneity of the species. Furthermore, our MLSA-and WGS-based trees suggest that all the varieties of the N. albida clade are likely to be independent species (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>). However, the complete reclassification of N. albida must include (either as the seven-gene dataset, but preferably WGS) recently described N. nivalis and N. brisbanensis, the varieties N. albida var. kuetzingii and N. albida var. ovalis, as well as some present synonyms of the N. albida, namely Torulopsis rotundata and Torulopsis nadaensis <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Fonseca et al. 2011)</ref>. In addition, WGS-based phylogeny of the strains NY-1402, N6, and I2-R1 from public databases revealed that strain NY-1402 is potentially a novel species and two other strains (N6, isolated from deep-sea sediment and I2-R1, isolated from an ISS HEPA filter for a rodent experiment) should be assigned to N. tulchinskyi. These examples show that MLSA and WGS analyses are necessary to avoid misidentification <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Taylor and Fisher 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Liu et al. 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al. 2015a, b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">Vu et al. 2016)</ref>.</p><p>Naganishia strains phylogenetically close to N. kalamii are well-adapted to cold environments.

Since future space missions-for example, ESA JUpiter ICy moons Explorer and NASA Europa Clipper missionsare designed to explore the potential habitability of icy moons, the presence of cold-adapted yeasts should be monitored in the NASA cleanrooms. For future missions, monitoring psychrophiles, xerophiles and halophiles in SAFs is of particular interest because they may be capable of surviving inside or under the icy crust of Europa due to its extremely cold and saline environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Marion et al. 2003)</ref>. For instance, C. lysiniphilum and C. slooffiae are reported as halotolerant species <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Mokhtarnejad et al. 2016)</ref>. Similarly, C. onofrii shows moderately halophilic aptitude since it exhibits growth at 10% NaCl.</p><p>In general, SAF surfaces are decontaminated with reagents and also kept dry. Our genomic analysis reveals that both Naganishia and Cystobasidium species have predicted proteins (Pfam and Interpro terms) associated with dehydration and desiccation stress-response. Halotolerance is another adaptation required for yeasts typically active in hyper-arid regions, and so the halophilic traits detected in the genomes of these species also likely contributes to their survival in the cleanroom environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Buzzini and Margesin 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Logan et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Yurkov et al. 2022)</ref>.

Another species of the genus, N. friedmannii tested for desiccation (along with stratospheric low pressure and temperature and UV exposure) during stratospheric balloon flights, recorded larger numbers of viable cells than bacterial spores. Presence of the genetic traits associated with desiccation and oligotrophy were present in N. kalamii and C. onofrii, promoting their presence to the stringent conditions found in cleanrooms. Our genomic analysis revealed that along with genes related to desiccation tolerance, genes related to UV resistance are present in both Naganishia and Cystobasidium members. However, the only strain exhibiting all gene ontology terms involved in UV resistance is N. vishniacii ANT03-052, firstly isolated from the McMurdo Dry Valleys (Antarctica), a terrestrial Mars analogue.

Indeed, we found that the polar yeast N. onofrii is more resistant to UV-C radiation compared to the pigmented C. onofrii, which is capable of synthesizing carotenoids with UV shielding properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Moliné et al. 2010</ref>).

Moreover, serine proteases S33 and S09X found in N. kalamii, are essential hydrolytic enzymes with several functions such as protein maturation, signal peptide cleavage and transduction, and intracellular protein turnover. Although both are typically understudied in yeast, they have been suggested as a marker for saprotrophy in fungi as they are theorized to be less expressed in fungi with a pathogenic or animal-associated lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Muszewska et al. 2017</ref>). Furthermore, it has also been suggested that the relatively high abundance of the aminopeptidases M01 and the serine proteases S12, which are both detected in abundance in the genome of N. kalamii, may be an indicator of saprotrophy <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Muszewska et al. 2017</ref>). The same trend has been detected in C. onofrii. Furthermore, genes encoding a wide range of glycosyl hydrolases that have the capacity to degrade the major plant cell wall polymers (eg. AA1 for lignin and GH5 for cellulose breakdown) were found in both N. kalamii and C. onofrii. Acetyl esterases, found in C. onofrii, are an important component of the enzymatic machinery for fungal degradation of plant biomass and break down xylan-derived oligosaccharides and on galactoglucomannan <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">(Venegas et al. 2022)</ref>.

The synthesis of extracellular enzymes which degrade organic matter and release nutrients is crucial for the survival of saprotrophs. However, by comparing the gene conservation and functional annotation of the two yeasts described here, we observed a loss in gene family (PFAM terms and GO-term counts) in both species, which is usually ated with a host/substrate shift from plants to animals. It is worth mentioning that the loss is more remarkable in N. kalamii <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Muszewska et al. 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>This study underscores the extreme, oligotrophic conditions of meticulously maintained NASA cleanrooms, which could potentially house various microbes, including significant yeast species. Traditional yeast identification methods are deemed inadequate, highlighting the need for more precise techniques like MLSA and WGS, particularly for complex genera like Naganishia. The study also warns about these UV-C resistant yeasts, including high-altitude, cold-adapted N. onofrii and two other NASA cleanroom species, to potentially contaminate extraterrestrial environments, thereby posing risks to life-detection missions. The presence of these coldadapted yeasts in SAF bears implications for future missions to icy moons. Genomic analysis further reveals the potential for survival in harsh conditions, pointing to genes linked with desiccation tolerance and UV resistance.</p><p>The research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (80NM0018D0004). © 2023 All rights reserved.
