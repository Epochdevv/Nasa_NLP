<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In P. aeruginosa, alginate overproduction, also known as mucoidy, is negatively regulated by the transmembrane protein MucA, which sequesters the alternative sigma factor AlgU. MucA is degraded via a proteolysis pathway that frees AlgU from sequestration, activating alginate biosynthesis. Initiation of this pathway normally requires two signals: peptide sequences in unassembled outer-membrane proteins (OMPs) activate the AlgW protease, and unassembled lipopolysaccharides bind periplasmic MucB, releasing MucA and facilitating its proteolysis by activated AlgW. To search for novel alginate regulators, we screened a transposon library in the non-mucoid reference strain PAO1, and identified a mutant that confers mucoidy through overexpression of a protein encoded by the chaperone-usher pathway gene cupB5. CupB5dependent mucoidy occurs through the AlgU pathway and can be reversed by overexpression of MucA or MucB. In the presence of activating OMP peptides, peptides corresponding to a region of CupB5 needed for mucoidy further stimulated AlgW cleavage of MucA in vitro. Moreover, the CupB5 peptide allowed OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA in the presence of the MucB inhibitor. These results support a novel mechanism for conversion to mucoidy in which the proteolytic activity of AlgW and its ability to compete with MucB for MucA is mediated by independent peptide signals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic human pathogen, capable of thriving in different environmental niches. Activation of the AlgU-regulated extracytoplasmic stress response results in the production of copious amounts of an exopolysaccharide called alginate, forming a capsule that protects the bacterium from the host-immune system. Alginate production by P. aeruginosa is a particular problem for patients with cystic fibrosis, whose dehydrated mucus-filled lungs provide an environment especially suited for bacterial infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Folkesson et al., 2012)</ref>. Nonmucoid strains initially colonize the lungs, and alginate overproduction caused by mutations in mucA results in a mucoid phenotype and a chronic lung infection <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Ciofu et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hogardt et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Mena et al., 2008)</ref>. Among many roles in pathogenesis, alginate can promote adherence to lung epithelial cells, reduce the efficiency of phagocytosis, and protect bacteria from antibiotics <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Govan and Deretic, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Pier et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Leid et al., 2005)</ref>.</p><p>The extracytoplasmic stress-response pathways in P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and other Gram-negative bacteria involve regulated intramembrane proteolysis and share common features. For example, outer-membrane and periplasmic stress initiates a proteolytic cascade that ultimately degrades a transmembrane anti-sigma factor and releases the sigma factor to up-regulate stress-response genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alba et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kanehara et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Walsh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Akiyama et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flynn et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chaba et al., 2007)</ref>. In P. aeruginosa, proteolysis of wild type MucA, the anti-sigma factor, releases the AlgU sigma factor, which enhances transcription of the genes responsible for alginate biosynthesis from the algD promoter <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Martin et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Wood et al., 2006)</ref>.</p><p>In P. aeruginosa, degradation of MucA is normally initiated by cleavage by the AlgW protease at site 1 near the periplasmic face of the inner membrane, continues with cleavage by the MucP protease at site 2 near the cytoplasmic face of the membrane, and is completed in the cytoplasm by AAA+ proteases such as ClpXP <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akiyama et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Alba et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Chaba et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Flynn et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kanehara et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Qiu et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Walsh et al., 2003)</ref>. Two signals are required to initiate this proteolytic cascade. The C-terminal peptides of proteins that accumulate in the periplasm during stress, including outer-membrane proteins (OMPs), bind to the PDZ domains of the trimeric AlgW protease and allosterically activate site-1 cleavage of MucA, but MucB competes for MucA binding and can inhibit this cleavage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009)</ref>. Recent studies show that lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a key component of the outer membrane, can bind MucB and cause release of MucA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lima et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Here, we identify CupB5 as a novel activator of the alginate-production pathway. CupB5, an adhesive protein, is a member of one of the chaperone/usher pathways (CupA-E) that mediate assembly of pili and play roles in bacterial pathogenesis, adhesion, and biofilm formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hull et al., 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Marklund et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Soto and Hultgren, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Vallet et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Giraud et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Mikkelsen et al., 2009)</ref>. These secretion systems, which are best characterized in Gram-negative bacteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Sauer et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Waksman and Hultgren, 2009)</ref>, contain a periplasmic chaperone that maintains proteins to be secreted in an unassembled state and an usher that transports these proteins through the outer membrane. We find that overexpression of CupB5 in the absence of its chaperone induces a mucoid phenotype in P. aeruginosa and provide evidence that a peptide signal in CupB5 enhances OMP-activated cleavage of MucA by AlgW, even in the presence of MucB, allowing initiation of AlgU signaling.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Overexpression of CupB5 induces mucoidy</head><p>To identify new alginate regulatory genes, we performed mariner-transposon mutagenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Wong and Mekalanos, 2000)</ref> in the nonmucoid P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1. We isolated a mucoid variant (PAO1-VE22) and identified the site of a single-copy insertion by inverse PCR and Southern-blot analysis (data not shown). The transposon insertion was six base pairs before the TAG stop codon at the 3′ end of cupB4 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>) and introduced a σ 70dependent P Gm promoter that drove expression of the gentamicin resistance cassette and downstream genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Rubin et al., 1999)</ref>. Alginate production by PAO1-VE22 (31 ± 1.5 μg/ml/OD 600 ) was substantially higher than that of PAO1 (8.5 ± 0.02 μg/ml/OD 600 ) after 24 h growth at 37°C. To test if altered expression of cupB4, cupB5, or cupB6 was responsible for the mucoidy of PAO1-VE22, we cloned each individual coding sequence with an Nterminal HA epitope and C-terminal H 6 tag in pHERD20T under control of an arabinoseinducible promoter <ref type="bibr">(Qiu et al., 2008a)</ref>. Plasmids expressing the tagged variant of CupB5, but not of CupB4 or CupB6, induced mucoid conversion and high-level alginate production in PAO1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Western-blot analysis indicated that the plasmid-expressed CupB4, CupB5, and CupB6 variants were detectable when overexpressed in PAO1, albeit with fragmentation of CupB5 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). We conclude that enhanced expression of CupB5 or a CupB5 fragment induces mucoidy and increased alginate in PAO1-VE22.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genetic requirements for CupB5-induced mucoidy</head><p>Deletion of five single genes required for the AlgU response <ref type="bibr">(algW, mucP, clpX, clpP, or algU)</ref> in PAO1 prevented mucoidy and high-level alginate production when HA-CupB5-H 6 was overproduced from a plasmid in these strains (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). In-frame deletion of algW in PAO1-VE22 also prevented alginate overproduction and mucoidy, a phenotype that was complemented by plasmid expression of AlgW but not AlgW lacking its PDZ domain (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). Consistently, when AlgU-dependent promoters were fused to lacZ and introduced into PAO1-VE22 or PAO1-VE2, a strain in which AlgW is activated by overproduction of MucE <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Qiu et al., 2007)</ref>, β-galactosidase levels were increased markedly compared to the same promoter fusions in PAO1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">S1</ref>). CupB5 is normally an extracellular protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Ruer et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Vallet et al., 2001)</ref>. However, its overexpression in the absence of corresponding levels of the CupB4 chaperone and usher could result in periplasmic accumulation that acts directly or indirectly through AlgW to activate alginate production.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CupB5 contains an internal signal for alginate overproduction</head><p>Because C-terminal sequences terminating with an aromatic residue and α-carboxylate can activate AlgW, we initially tested if the C-terminal residues of CupB5 (Asn 1016 -Ile 1017 -Trp 1018 ) were responsible for activating AlgW and inducing mucoidy. However, overexpression of CupB5 variants with a C-terminal H 6 tag or containing a deletion of the Asn 1016 -Ile 1017 -Trp 1018 sequence and a C-terminal H 6 tag still induced mucoidy in PAO1 (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>). Thus, the extreme C-terminal residues of CupB5 play little or no role in mediating alginate overproduction. Moreover, overproduction of variants containing just the N-terminal 491 residues of CupB5 also induced mucoidy (Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>), indicating that a major inducing signal is located in this portion of the protein.</p><p>Deletion analyses revealed that the Thr 489 -Val 490 -Val 491 sequence of CupB5 appeared important for alginate overproduction. Specifically, overexpression of CupB5 1-491 produced substantially more alginate than overexpression of CupB5 1-489 or CupB5 1-488 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3A</ref>), and Western blotting showed that these proteins were present at a similar intracellular levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3B</ref>). Cells expressing CupB5 1-490 also produced less alginate (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3A</ref>), but this protein appeared to be severely truncated by degradation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">3B</ref>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that the CupB5 activating signal included some or all of the Thr 489 -Val 490 -Val 491 sequence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CupB5 peptides stimulate OMP-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA and partially relieve MucB inhibition in vitro</head><p>We initially tested if synthetic peptides including the Thr 489 -Val 490 -Val 491 CupB5 sequence might stimulate alginate production in a manner analogous to OMPs by activating AlgW cleavage of 35 S-MucA. One peptide (GYYYTVV) corresponded to the seven C-terminal residues of CupB5 1-491 , another (YVGYVTY) was a sequence-scrambled variant, and a third (GYYYT) corresponded to the C-terminus of CupB5 1-489 , which did not stimulate alginate production in vivo. We assayed the kinetics of AlgW cleavage of 35 S-MucA in vitro by the production of acid-soluble peptide fragments in the presence of different concentrations of the CupB5 peptides. Each CupB5 peptide stimulated AlgW cleavage of 35 S-MucA to a small degree, but at far lower rates than a peptide (WVF) corresponding to the C-terminal residues of MucE, a potent activator of AlgW (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4A</ref> &amp; <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4B</ref>). Thus, the CupB5 peptides do not substitute for OMP-like peptides in robust activation of AlgW cleavage of MucA.</p><p>As expected from previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2009)</ref>, addition of MucB suppressed cleavage of 35 S-MucA by WVF-activated AlgW (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4C</ref>). Moreover, addition of just the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT CupB5 peptides did not result in AlgW cleavage of MucA when MucB was present (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4C</ref>). Next, we tested if the wild-type or scrambled CupB5 peptides could relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of 35 S-MucA in the presence of the WVF activating peptide. Importantly, titration of GYYYTVV or GYYYT into reactions containing MucA, MucB, AlgW, and WVF peptide resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the rate of MucA cleavage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4D</ref>). Almost no increase in MucA cleavage was observed with the scrambled YVGYVTY peptide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4D</ref>), demonstrating sequence specificity. Interestingly, activation of MucA cleavage by GYYYT occurred at lower peptide concentrations and was less cooperative as judged by the Hill constant than activation by the GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4D</ref>). Thus, the C-terminal valine residues of GYYYTVV are not necessary for activation of MucA cleavage in the presence of MucB in vitro. Although the GYYYTVV and GYYYT peptides activated AlgW cleavage of MucA to similar levels in the presence of WVF peptide and MucB, these levels were approximately one-third of the MucA cleavage rate observed with WVF and AlgW alone (compare Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4B</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4D</ref>). We conclude that the CupB5 peptides can partially relieve MucB inhibition of WVF-activated AlgW cleavage of MucA.</p><p>Lipopolysaccharides bind MucB and competitively displace MucA <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lima et al., 2013)</ref>. Because MucB normally binds peptide sequences in MucA, it seemed plausible that CupB5 peptides might also compete for MucA binding to MucB. We tested this possibility by assaying the ability of the CupB5 peptides to elute 35 S-MucB from MucA that had been covalently bound to agarose resin (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5A</ref>). In this assay, the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment and free MucA efficiently competed with resin-bound MucA for MucB binding. However, incubation of 35 S-MucB•MucA resin with the GYYYTVV, YVGYVTY, or GYYYT peptides resulted in no more 35 S-MucB release than observed in the buffer control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5A</ref>). This result strongly suggests that the CupB5 peptides do not relieve MucB inhibition by directly competing for its binding to MucA. Binding of the L-IIA lipopolysaccharide fragment converts MucB dimers to tetramers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Lima et al., 2013)</ref>. By contrast, incubation of MucB with GYYYTVV peptide resulted in no substantial change in elution during gel-filtration chromatography (Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>).</p><p>Because CupB5 peptides did not strongly activate AlgW cleavage of MucA in the absence of the WVF peptide or release MucA from MucB, we speculated that they might act in concert with the WVF peptide to allow AlgW to bind and degrade MucA more efficiently and thus to compete better with MucB for the MucA substrate. This model predicts that MucA should be degraded at a faster rate in the presence of both the WVF and CupB5 peptides. Indeed, when we assayed the rate of cleavage of different concentrations of 35 S-MucA by AlgW, faster cleavage was observed when both the WVF and wild-type CupB5 peptides were present compared to only the WVF peptide or the WVF peptide and scrambled CupB5 control peptide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5B</ref>). We also measured the rate of AlgW cleavage of a fixed concentration of MucA in the presence of increasing concentrations of WVF peptide with or without additional GYYYTVV peptide (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5C</ref>). When GYYYTVV peptide was present, the maximum rate of MucA cleavage increased almost two-fold. We conclude that the CupB5 peptides and WVF peptide act synergistically to enhance AlgW cleavage of MucA, allowing better competition with MucB.</p><p>In E. coli, RseA, RseB, and DegS are homologs of MucA, MucB, and AlgW. A YYF peptide efficiently activates DegS cleavage of RseA in the absence of RseB or in the presence of both RseB and lipopolysaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Walsh et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cezairliyan and Sauer, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Lima et al., 2013)</ref>. The CupB5 peptides did not substantially stimulate cleavage of 35 S-RseA by YYF-activated DegS in the presence of RseB (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S3</ref>), suggesting that they do not interact with DegS. This result is not surprising, as DegS and AlgW share only 44% sequence homology.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Suppressing and enhancing alginate production</head><p>If CupB5 allows AlgW to compete more efficiently with MucB for MucA binding and cleavage, then overproduction of MucB in strain PAO1-VE22 would be expected to decrease alginate production. Indeed, plasmid-mediated MucB overproduction had this effect, as did plasmid-mediated overproduction of MucA (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6A</ref>). The latter result suggests that with enough additional uncleaved MucA, AlgU is efficiently inhibited even when more MucA is degraded than usual. Even the CupB5-induced elevated rate of AlgW cleavage of MucA in this strain must be too slow to free enough AlgU to fully enhance transcription of alginate biosynthesis genes.</p><p>Plasmid-expressed MucB or MucA also decreased alginate production in PAO1-VE2, a strain expressing higher MucE levels (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6A</ref>). The rate of AlgW cleavage of MucA in PAO1-VE2 is apparently too low to fully degrade the excess MucA, resulting in greater inhibition of AlgU and reduced alginate production. Excess MucB presumably outstrips the endogenous anti-MucB signals in PAO1-VE2 and mass action results in enhanced binding to MucA, reducing the rate of MucA cleavage by activated AlgW.</p><p>To determine how simultaneous overexpression of MucE and CupB5 affected alginate levels,, we transformed PAO1-VE2 with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB5-H 6 . Notably, alginate levels in this strain were higher than in the empty-vector control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6B</ref>), suggesting that activation of AlgW through MucE and through CupB5 occur synergistically. Our biochemical results predict that MucB should not be genetically required for CupB5mediated pathway activation. To test this prediction, we used a transposon-insertion strain, PAO1-mucB::tet R , which displayed an elevated level of basal alginate production and mucoid phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6B</ref>). When we transformed PAO1-mucB::tet R with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB5-H 6 , alginate production increased compared to the empty-vector control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6B</ref>), indicating that CupB5 overexpression induces pathway activation by a MucB-independent mechanism. Finally, we tested if expression of the CupB4 chaperone, which should facilitate export of CupB5 rather than its periplasmic accumulation, would decrease alginate production. Indeed, when we transformed PAO1-VE22 with a plasmid expressing HA-CupB4-H 6 , alginate production was suppressed and the mucoid phenotype of the parent strain was reversed (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6B</ref>). This result supports a model in which interactions between accumulated periplasmic CupB5 and periplasmic AlgW leads to induction of alginate production and mucoidy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Based on results from a transposon screen in P. aeruginosa, we discovered that overexpression of CupB5, a protein normally secreted through the outer membrane by a chaperone-usher system, activates alginate production and results in mucoid colonies. CupB5-mediated mucoidy depends on known components of the AlgU stress-response pathway, including the AlgU transcription factor and the AlgW, MucP, and ClpXP proteases. Peptides from a region of CupB5 important for elevated alginate production in vivo stimulate cleavage of MucA by OMP-activated AlgW in vitro and partially relieve MucB inhibition of AlgW cleavage of MucA. Overexpression of either MucB or MucA in strains that overexpress CupB5 also reduces alginate production, supporting a model in which excess periplasmic CupB5 stimulates proteolytic cleavage of MucA by AlgW.</p><p>We found that expression of HA-CupB5 1-491 -H 6 in PAO1 increased alginate production in vivo and demonstrated that a GYYYTVV peptide (corresponding to CupB5 residues 485-491) antagonized MucB inhibition in vitro. A peptide with the same composition as GYYYTVV but a scrambled sequence did not inhibit MucB. However, we also found that expression of HA-CupB5 1-489 -H 6 failed to increase alginate production in vivo, whereas a GYYYT peptide (corresponding to CupB5 residues 485-489) did antagonize MucB inhibition in vitro. This discrepancy between results in vivo and in vitro could arise because the GYYYT peptide in HA-CupB5 1-489 -H 6 is altered by proteolysis or is masked by tertiary structure, aggregation, or binding to another cellular component. We also note that expression of full-length HA-CupB5-H 6 and truncated HA-CupB5 1-585 -H 6 resulted in somewhat higher alginate levels than expression of HA-CupB5 1-491 -H 6 . This variation could arise from differences in expression levels, cellular interactions, or possibly as a consequence of additional peptide sequences in the longer proteins that facilitate pathway activation.</p><p>We initially thought that CupB5 peptides might bind MucB and compete for binding to MucA in a manner analogous to LPS. However, neither GYYYTVV nor GYYYT peptides compete with MucA-agarose for MucB binding and saturating concentrations of these peptides only partially relieve MucB inhibition in vitro. Moreover, unlike LPS, GYYYTVV did not convert MucB dimers into tetramers. By themselves, CupB5 peptides activate AlgW cleavage in vitro far less well than the OMP-like WVF peptide. However, CupB5 peptides stimulate MucA cleavage by WVF-activated AlgW, suggesting that OMP-like and CupB5 peptides bind to distinct sites in AlgW but have a common effect of stabilizing the proteolytically active enzyme.</p><p>The GYYYTVV sequence is conserved in CupB5 proteins from different strains of P. aeruginosa but not in CupB5 proteins from other Pseudomonas species (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S3</ref>), and some Pseudomonas species have no CupB5 ortholog. Thus, CupB5 activation of AlgW is specific to P. aeruginosa. It remains to be determined if P. aeruginosa utilizes other proteins in this manner or if AlgW homologs in other bacteria are activated by more than one kind of peptide signal.</p><p>Activation of the AlgU pathway requires one molecular signal (C-terminal OMP peptides) to activate site-1 cleavage of MucA by the AlgW protease and a second molecular signal (LPS) to relieve MucB inhibition of this cleavage. Overproduction of CupB5 can partially bypass this second requirement by helping OMP-bound AlgW compete with MucB for MucA binding and proteolysis. Expression of CupB5 under non-stress conditions increases alginate production similarly to non-stress expression of MucE <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Qiu et al., 2007)</ref>. In these experiments, a signal that directly antagonizes MucB inhibition could arise indirectly as a consequence of other molecules whose concentrations increase as a consequence of CupB5 or MucE expression or might always be present at some level in the periplasm. For example, some level of unassembled OMPs and LPS is probably always present in the periplasm. Notably, however, simultaneous expression of CupB5 and MucE results in higher levels of alginate, indicating that these signals activate the alginate pathway through synergistic mechanisms Although CupB5 peptides, OMP peptides, and LPS molecules function by different mechanisms to activate AlgW or relieve MucB inhibition, the molecular logic that gives rise to all three signals is similar. For example, stresses that compromise the transport to and outer-membrane assembly of OMPs and LPS, or that slow usher-mediated CupB5 secretion, would all lead to the periplasmic accumulation of these molecules and activation of the AlgU pathway. Indeed, we found that alginate production was suppressed in strains that overproduced the CupB4 chaperone, allowing export of CupB5. Certain stresses might only activate AlgW through OMP signals, whereas others require an enhanced response via CupB5 or possibly other proteins secreted through the outer membrane. Clearly, however, the AlgU system integrates multiple signals, each reporting on potential dysfunction in outer-membrane assembly, structure, and/or secretion. Dysfunction in just one pathway should give rise to a buffered AlgU response, whereas dysfunction affecting multiple pathways would elicit a robust AlgU response.</p></div>
