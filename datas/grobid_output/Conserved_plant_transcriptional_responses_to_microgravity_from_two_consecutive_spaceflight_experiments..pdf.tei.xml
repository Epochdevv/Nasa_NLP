<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Introduction: Understanding how plants adapt to the space environment is essential, as plants will be a valuable component of long duration space missions. Several spaceflight experiments have focused on transcriptional profiling as a means of understanding plant adaptation to microgravity. However, there is limited overlap between results from different experiments. Differences in experimental conditions and hardware make it difficult to find a consistent response across experiments and to distinguish the primary effects of microgravity from other spaceflight effects.</p><p>Methods: Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) were two separate spaceflight experiments conducted on the International Space Station utilizing the European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS). The EMCS provided a lighted environment for plant growth with centrifugal capabilities providing an onboard 1 g control.</p><p>Results and discussion: An RNA-Seq analysis of shoot samples from PS and PRR revealed a significant overlap of genes differentially expressed in microgravity between the two experiments. Relative to onboard 1 g controls, genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and response to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity in both experiments. Conversely, genes involved in defense response, abiotic stress, Ca ++ signaling, and cell wall modification were commonly downregulated in both datasets. The downregulation of stress responses in microgravity in these two experiments is interesting as these pathways have been previously observed as upregulated in spaceflight compared to ground controls. Similarly, we have observed many stress response genes to be upregulated in the 1 g onboard control compared to ground reference controls; however these genes were specifically downregulated in microgravity. In addition, we analyzed the sRNA landscape of the 1 g and microgravity (m g) shoot samples from PRR. We identified three miRNAs (miR319c, miR398b, and miR8683)    </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>As an essential part of life support systems for long-duration space missions, plants supplement food as well as purify the air and water <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fu et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">De Micco et al., 2023)</ref>. Future colonization efforts will require the ability to grow plants in unfamiliar environments. However, the space environment poses challenges to growing plants. In addition to the difficulties of providing essential requirements for plant growth <ref type="bibr">(light, water, nutrients, etc.)</ref>, growing plants in space requires the mitigation of unfavorable factors such as altered gas composition, lack of convective currents, and cosmic radiation.</p><p>It is important to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate plant adaptations to space. Toward that goal, several spaceflight experiments have examined the global transcriptional changes of plants grown on the International Space Station (ISS). One caveat to these studies is that until recently, lighted habitats for plant experimentation were limited; for ease of handling and setup, several experiments were carried out in Biological Research In Canisters hardware (BRICs), where plants were grown in the dark. Another point of concern is that many spaceflight experiments have employed hardware-matched experiments on Earth as controls; however, it is difficult to replicate all of the stresses that plants may face on the ISS on the ground.</p><p>Further, while several transcriptional datasets have been generated (accessible through the NASA GeneLab data repository), differences in plant age, tissue type, and growth conditions confound efforts to separate primary responses to microgravity from other spaceflight related stress responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Manzano et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Olanrewaju et al., 2023)</ref>. A recent metaanalysis by <ref type="bibr">Barker et al.</ref> clearly illustrates some of these confounding effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Barker et al., 2023)</ref>. The authors showed that the analysis method (RNA-Seq vs. microarrays) was a principal factor leading to variability between datasets as was the hardware utilized for the spaceflight experiments. Nevertheless, focusing only on experiments conducted in BRIC hardware helped uncover common responses. Namely, oxidative stress, heat shock, cell wall dynamics, hypoxia, and ROS signaling were Gene Ontology annotations enriched in spaceflight compared to ground controls.</p><p>A transcriptional profiling study of 12 day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown in the Advanced Biological Research System (ABRS) hardware found organ-specific gene expression changes between leaves, hypocotyls, and roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Paul et al., 2013)</ref>. Although each tissue exhibited unique responses, cell wall remodeling, touch response, and pathogen responses were common themes among the genes differentially expressed in space.</p><p>Plant growth is highly responsive to external cues. Two critical cues -light and gravity-have profound influences on the direction and magnitude of plant growth. Plant roots grow down with the gravity vector (positive gravitropism), while the stems grow opposite to the gravity vector (negative gravitropism) and toward light (positive phototropism). On earth, light and gravity work in combination to direct the orientation of the primary axes of growth as well as root and shoot branching and leaf angle, enabling efficient nutrient acquisition and light capture. The relative contribution of each of these cues in regulating plant growth is difficult to disentangle on Earth, where gravity is a constant; the ISS provides an ideal platform to answer such fundamental questions.</p><p>The European Modular Cultivation System (EMCS) was one of the controlled environment plant growth habitats operational on the ISS for many years <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Brinckmann, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kittang et al., 2014)</ref>. In addition to providing lighting, regulated air circulation, and ethylene scrubbing, the EMCS was unique in that it consisted of two centrifuge rotors within a growth chamber. Rotor speeds could be varied to impart g levels ranging from 0 -2 g. The EMCS, therefore, afforded researchers the ability to conduct a simultaneous 1 g control in space as well as to specifically query the effects of partial gravity.</p><p>Spaceflight experiments utilizing EMCS hardware have attempted to uncouple light and gravity stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Millar et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vandenbrink et al., 2016)</ref>. Some experiments have examined the transcriptional response of plants to partial g levels. We previously reported that a subset of genes differentially expressed in microgravity respond to incremental increases in g levels <ref type="bibr">(Sheppard et al., 2021)</ref>. Other researchers have compared differences in gene expression between Lunar or Martian gravity and onboard 1 g controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Herranz et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Villacampa et al., 2021)</ref>. These types of experiments can inform us on plant responses to extraterrestrial habitats and will be important for aiding with long term colonization efforts.</p><p>In this study, we compare the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis shoots from two independent spaceflight experiments conducted on the ISS. In both experiments, Arabidopsis seedlings were grown for 5-6 days in the EMCS. The results revealed considerable overlap between the two experiments despite differences in the experimental setup. Furthermore, onboard 1 g controls facilitated the identification of microgravity-specific differences in gene expression.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Preflight ground testing</head><p>Prior to flight build, optimization was carried out at North Carolina State University with a focus on seed stock viability, experimental protocols, and downstream sample recovery and processing. Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seed stocks were carefully screened to obtain an average germination of ≥99%, and dissection and processing protocols were developed to recover ≥1mg RNA from ≤3mg input tissue with a high degree of RNA integrity. Seed storage tests were carried out to ensure the viability of sterilized seeds for at least a 6 month period. Preflight testing for Plant Signaling (PS) included a Schedule Test and Operations Verification Test (OVT) at the Norwegian User Support and Operations Center (N-USOC, Trondheim, Norway), in an Engineering Reference Module (ERM-1). Similarly, ahead of the Plant RNA Regulation (PRR) spaceflight, an Experiment Verification Test (EVT) at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) in an EMCS ground facility (ERM-2), and an Operations Verification Test (OVT) in the EMCS Engineering Reference Module (ERM-1) at N-USOC were carried out. All preflight and flight preparations for seed, media, and hardware assembly were carried out at NASA ARC.</p></div>

Whatman #3 blotter paper and black-gridded PES membrane (PALL life Sciences Cat. No. 65561) were cut to fit the seed cassettes. Blotter papers were pre-soaked in 0.5X MS media, pH 5.7 (without sucrose) and allowed to dry. Blotter papers and membranes were sterilized by autoclaving. Seeds were surface sterilized and allowed to dry for 2 hours. Healthy viable seeds were selected under a dissecting microscope and attached to the gridded membrane using guar gum. Seeds were positioned with micropyles pointing down (away from lights) with 27 seeds/membrane. Gridded seeded membranes were attached to prepared blotters with guar gum and fixed to cassette base plates. Cassette covers were installed and sealed with foil tape (3M). A total of 80 cassettes were prepared for each experiment. Seed cassettes were assembled for flight at NASA ARC and loaded into experimental containers (ECs) approximately 4 weeks prior to the scheduled flight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Spaceflight</head><p>Onboard the ISS, ECs were loaded into the EMCS by the attending astronaut. Each EC contained 5 seed cassettes for a total of 4 ECs (20 seed cassettes)/centrifuge rotor. Experiments were initiated by hydration, controlled remotely. The experimental timelines for PS and PRR are shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Both experiments were illuminated by white LEDs along the shoot side of the cassettes, and both experiments consisted of two replicate experimental runs. PS was carried out under continuous light, while PRR employed a long-day light regime (16h light/8h dark). Images were obtained from cameras located within the EMCS chamber. EMCS environmental parameters for PS were set at 21% O 2 and a constant seedling temperature of 24°C. For PS, the ambient cabin air was purged from the EMCS chamber prior to each experimental run so that CO 2 levels gradually increased to equilibrate with the cabin (beginning ~370 ppm and equilibrating to ~760 ppm). EMCS environmental parameters for PRR were set at 21% O 2 , 24°C daytime seedling temperature, and 21°C nighttime seedling temperature. Due to constraints with the upmass of air gas canisters, the EMCS chamber was not purged prior to each run of PRR; chamber CO 2 for the duration of PRR was similar to the ISS cabin (~3000 ppm). In both PS and PRR, environmental factors were monitored by realtime telemetry to record O 2 , CO 2 , seedling temperature, and relative humidity. At the end of the experiments, seed cassettes were removed from the ECs, with 1 g cassettes handled first, and frozen immediately in the onboard -80°C freezer (MELFI). Seed cassettes remained frozen onboard the ISS. Samples were maintained at cryogenic temperature during return via Space-X Dragon, after splashdown, and until delivery to the laboratory. Samples were then stored at -80°C until processing for RNA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Ground reference controls</head><p>For both PS and PRR, ground reference experiments were carried out in the ERM-2 at NASA-ARC, using flight build spares and matching environmental parameters to the flight experiments. Briefly, this hardware was designed to replicate environmental conditions experienced aboard the ISS to include temperature, gas composition, and provide comparable support to the flight hardware. Experimental containers (ECs) were positioned in the ERM in an upright position such that seedlings grew vertically, with lighting provided within each seed cassette from above the germinating seedlings, similar to the flight configuration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">RNA isolation</head><p>All analyzed shoot samples for the 1 g controls were from seed cassettes in position 3 of each EC. For PS, position 3 corresponded to 0.76 g and for PRR position 3 corresponded to 1 g (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). For each RNA isolation, seed cassettes were processed singly as follows. A single seed cassette was retrieved from the freezer, and the cover was removed. The cassette base was placed on a chilled platform, and RNA-later (Thermo Fisher Cat. No. AM7021) was added. The seedlings were dissected into root and shoot fractions and stored at 4°C in RNA-later for 24 hours, followed by storage at -20°C until RNA isolation. RNA was isolated from each shoot sample using the RNAqueous Micro kit (Applied Biosystems Cat No. AM1931). RNA recovery and integrity were monitored by Bioanalyzer (Agilent 2100). For the PRR shoot samples, the RNA isolation protocol was modified in order to retain the small RNA fraction as well.</p></div>

Libraries were prepared using the ultra-directional library prep kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). Sequencing was carried out on 3 lanes of Illumina HiSeq2500 (125 bp single end reads).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Experimental setup and growth parameters</head><p>To minimize the impact of handling and transport, seeds were drymounted on membranes and remained dormant until hydration at the initiation of each experimental run. The dry seed configuration with an on-orbit hydration also eliminated the need for late loading and allowed for flexibility in the event of flight scrubbing or delayed experiment initiation. Following hydration and illumination, seedlings from PS and PRR germinated with high frequency (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) and exhibited nominal growth across each run of both experiments. Differences in experimental design (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) included the presence/absence of a day/night cycle, total experiment length, and centrifugal profiles. Notably, PS incorporated 48 hours of initial 1 g treatment at the start of the experiment. For the later experiment, PRR, the m g rotor remained stationary for the entire duration of the experiment. A morphological difference was observed between these experiments, characterized by a largely uniform orientation of seedling roots in PS, in contrast to the more disordered growth patterns observed in PRR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>). This difference could be due to the initial gravitational cue provided to all seedlings in PS, the presence of a day/night cycle in PRR, or a combination of the two.

In total, we identified 1,819 and 1,792 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PS, and PRR, respectively. The overlap between the two experiments for both m g upregulated and m g downregulated DEG lists was significant (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Both experiments shared 178 genes upregulated in µ g and 399 genes downregulated in µ g. GO annotation revealed enrichment of the GO terms, "Regulation of Transcription" and "Auxin Signaling" in the common µ g upregulated genes. "Cell Wall" and "Response to Stress" were GO terms enriched in the common µ g downregulated genes.</p><p>To further compare the two experiments, RNA-Seq reads from PS and PRR were re-analyzed in a combined study to impart increased statistical power. DE-Seq2 analysis of this combined dataset revealed 1,112 genes upregulated in µ g and 1,429 genes downregulated in µ g (Supplementary Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). It should be noted that &gt;99% of DEGs identified as common to the two individual datasets listed above were similarly identified by this combined analysis.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Microgravity versus the space environment</head><p>Perhaps the most striking aspect of the DEGs that are downregulated in both PS and PRR is that &gt; 400 genes are associated with stress responses. This included a strong enrichment of biotic stress response (in particular, response to bacteria and chitin) and genes known to respond to many abiotic stresses, including salt and temperature. Curiously, these responses have been reported as upregulated in spaceflight experiments compared to ground controls. It is not surprising that the space environment poses several challenges to plants and many of these are not easy to measure or replicate on the ground. Although our focus in both PS and PRR spaceflights was the direct comparison of µ g with the onboard 1 g control, we also carried out ground controls where EMCS chamber conditions were matched in the ground reference module ERM-2. An examination of the DEGs between 1 g in space and ground controls revealed that many of these stress response-related genes were actually upregulated in 1 g compared to the ground. These observations indicate that the space environment (excluding µ g) enhanced the expression of these stress-related genes. However, this group of genes was specifically downregulated in µ g compared to 1 g suggesting that microgravity masks the induction of these genes in the space environment. Representative heat maps for select defense-related genes are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">5</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">7</ref>). As an example of an abiotic stress response, heat maps for a set of genes involved in salt stress are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">6</ref> (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">8</ref>). These heat maps clearly illustrate that the stress-related genes showed higher levels of expression in the spaceflight 1 g condition compared to either µ g or the ground controls. Since the 1 g and µ g experiments were conducted on two rotors held in the same chamber at the same time, we can be confident that all other "space-related" stimuli were shared between the two, and that the primary difference between them was the µ g treatment. The differences between 1 g and the ground control samples, would include all other effects of the space environment, excluding microgravity. It is clear that many of these genes would not have been detected as differentially expressed in the absence of the on board 1 g control and these results reveal that this control is critical in order to identify µ g specific changes.</p></div>

A majority of the 210 genes commonly downregulated in µ g at both Day 4 and Day 6, were related to abiotic and biotic stresses as described previously.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Conserved and unique transcriptional changes in microgravity</head><p>The PS and PRR spaceflight experiments were designed to examine early seedling development and responses to microgravity. To answer these questions, we utilized the EMCS facility with a rotor configuration selected to provide µ g and an onboard 1 g control. The two experiments were conducted at different times and had different lighting regimes as well as some other differences in set up as outlined in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>. Despite these differences, there was considerable parity between the DEGs in µ g between the two experiments. Genes upregulated in µ g compared to the 1 g control were primarily involved in leaf and shoot development. The majority of the upregulated TFs function to regulate these processes and the enrichment in auxin and vesicle transport also support growth processes. In contrast, there appears to be a substantial downregulation of both biotic and abiotic stress responses in µ g. Defense related genes were overrepresented and most of the downregulated TFs function in mediating plant stress responses (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">4</ref>). Additionally, we identified specific miRNAs that were differentially regulated in microgravity with coordinate regulation of their putative targets.</p><p>The large-scale downregulation in microgravity of stressresponse related genes in the PS and PRR flight experiments are somewhat at odds with other experiments where flight responses are compared to a ground control on Earth. In fact, we find that genes reported as upregulated in spaceflight appear to be downregulated in our datasets. For instance, 70 genes that were upregulated in spaceflight in BRIC19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Choi et al., 2019)</ref> are downregulated in µ g in our dataset. Many of these common genes are associated with response to stress and hypoxia.</p><p>We do however find more overlap in responses if we examine RNA-Seq datasets from other EMCS spaceflight experiments which utilized onboard 1 g controls. The Seedling Growth experiments (SG2 and SG3) were conducted in the EMCS; however these experiments included photostimulation with either unidirectional blue <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Herranz et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr">Vandenbrink et al., 2019)</ref> or red <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Villacampa et al., 2021)</ref> light for the final 48h of the experimental timeline. Although there was almost no overlap in DEGs upregulated in µ g; we do detect considerable overlap with µ g downregulated genes as well as genes downregulated in low (&lt;0.1) g <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Herranz et al., 2019)</ref>. Comparing our results to <ref type="bibr">Herranz et al.</ref> shows that 54 genes were commonly downregulated in µ g. Furthermore, 143 genes downregulated in low g were shared with genes downregulated in µ g in our data. Even more pronounced is the similarity in enriched GO terms for genes downregulated in µ g and low g compared to 1 g <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Herranz et al., 2019)</ref> and the genes downregulated in µ g in the PS/PRR data. These include, response to stimulus, response to abiotic stimulus and response to stress. Genes downregulated in µ g in with the red light photostimulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Villacampa et al., 2021)</ref> were enriched in the GO categories response to bacterium and fungus. Taken together these results further reinforce the idea that both biotic and abiotic stress responses appear to be specifically downregulated in µ g. This regulation would not have been detected without the onboard 1 g condition for comparison and these results point to the value of having an onboard 1 g control.</p><p>At least 4 different Arabidopsis ecotypes have been flown in space including Col-0, Ler, Ws and Cvi <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Paul et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Choi et al., 2019)</ref>. Interestingly, the Col-0 ecotype was found to be more responsive to the spaceflight environment compared to both Ws and Ler with more DEGs detected overall. A direct comparison of our results (on light grown Col-0 shoots) with the previous studies is hampered by the fact that they utilized either root tips or etiolated whole seedlings. Nevertheless, when we compare our findings with other spaceflight experiments, we find that two common features stand out; many experiments have reported altered expression of genes involved in cell wall modification and photosynthesis/plastid related genes. Two unexpected findings of our experiments are the potential regulation by the transcription factor Elongated Hypocotyl 5(HY5) and the altered expression of a few gravitropism related genes.</p></div>

However, we do see enrichment for genes involved in photosynthesis and plastid function downregulated in µ g. Plastid localization was an enriched GO term for cellular localization accounting for approximately 300 genes in the µ g downregulated category of our dataset. Genes encoding for subunits of the NADPH complex, LHCA and photosystem I and II core were downregulated in µ g in both PS and PRR. We also found that several of the µ g downregulated miRNA targets were associated with plastids. Since many of these spaceflight studies have focused on young Arabidopsis seedlings, it is not clear if the altered regulation of genes associated with photosynthesis and chloroplast function would persist in fully grown plants. Whether such adjustments continue to maturity and how they may impact the photosynthetic capacity of plants will need to be evaluated in future spaceflight experiments.</p></div>

HY5 is a central regulator of photomorphogenesis and may directly or indirectly affect the expression of approximately one third of the Arabidopsis genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lee et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gangappa and Botto, 2016)</ref>. HY5 is involved in integrating light and hormonal signals to regulate developmental processes in plants. In addition to a major role in light mediated signaling, HY5 is implicated in nutrient uptake and utilization, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and response to fluctuations in temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">(Xiao et al., 2021)</ref>. HY5 targets were significantly enriched in the genes upregulated in µ g (hypergeometric test, p=2.45e-11). The µ g upregulated HY5 targets were associated with organ development, light responses and auxin transport. We also found a significant enrichment of HY5 targets in the genes downregulated in µ g (hypergeometric test, p=1.698e-120). Many of the downregulated HY5 targets were involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.4">Gravitropism related genes</head><p>Curiously, we found some gravitropism related genes to be upregulated in µ g. Among these, the TF Shoot Gravitropism 5 (SGR5) was upregulated in µ g at both Day 4 and Day 6. SGR5 was first described as being important for the gravitropic response of Arabidopsis inflorescence stems <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">(Yamauchi et al., 1997)</ref>. Further studies showed that SGR5 is localized in the shoot endodermis and that amyloplast sedimentation in the shoot endodermis is slower in the sgr5 mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Morita et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Tanimoto et al., 2008)</ref>. SGR5 is also known as Indeterminate Domain 15 (IDD15). The IDD TFs IDD14, IDD15 and IDD16 have been shown to work cooperatively to regulate auxin transport in the shoot and play a role in aerial tissue development and gravitropic responses <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Cui et al., 2013)</ref>. We found IDD14 to be upregulated in µ g, as well as another gene involved in regulating gravitropic response -LAZY1. LAZY1 is expressed primarily in shoots of young seedlings and the early stages of the hypocotyl gravitropism were affected in a lazy1 mutant <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Yoshihara and Spalding, 2017)</ref>. The LAZY proteins are thought to act early in the gravity signaling cascade by transmitting positional information on amyloplast sedimentation upstream of auxin redistribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Nishimura et al., 2023)</ref>. The upregulation of these genes under µ g maybe related to their roles in regulating auxin flow; a closer look at their localization and dynamics under microgravity would be informative.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The Influence of developmental stage on observed transcriptional responses</head><p>The differences in gene expression between µ g and 1 g at Day 4 and Day 6 in PRR, revealed that many more genes were responsive to µ g at Day 6 than at Day 4. Since the Day 4 and Day 6 samples for each condition were obtained from the same rotor and collected at the same time, these differences suggest that the developmental stage of the seedlings can have a profound effect on observed transcriptional responses. The variation between Day 4 and Day 6 samples grown in 1 g and µ g, was also evident in the PCA plot where principal component 1, (which captured 53% of the variation between samples), clearly separated the Day 4 and Day 6 samples at 1 g; however, this separation was not observed in samples grown under the µ g condition. This indicates that differences in gene expression between the Day 4 and Day 6 samples in 1 g are either masked or not present in µ g. A possible explanation for this observation is that there are differences between 1 g and µ g grown seedlings in their developmental progression.</p><p>To determine if there were delays in germination between 1 g and µ g that could result in altered development we examined germination time by interrogating the sequential series of images obtained throughout the PRR experiment. We found no difference in the timing of the first occurrence of radicle emergence between µ g and 1 g seedlings. We conclude that there was no delay in germination under µ g; additionally, growth at Day 6 (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) was similar between µ g and 1 g conditions. Although we did not see gross differences in growth, given the short timeframe of this experiment, we cannot rule out that there may be subtle changes which could become more pronounced as the plants mature. Longer duration experiments with a finer resolution of time points would be required to fully characterize and understand the regulatory underpinnings for these differences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Lessons learned for future spaceflight experiments 4.3.1 Long term plant experiments</head><p>The PS and PRR experiments were focused on a narrow window of the Arabidopsis life cycle; the TROPI seed cassettes and EC arrangement only supported short duration experiments. Therefore we cannot extrapolate or assume that the transcriptional response to microgravity seen in these experiments would be universally applicable to long duration plant experiments on the ISS. Furthermore the seed cassettes provide a controlled optimal environment for seedling growth with sufficient lighting, moisture and humidity without inherent spaceflight associated limitations of water delivery that are manifest in larger plant growth habitats. Long term experiments where plants are grown from seed to maturity are needed to characterize critical stages in plant development. This approach will lead to a better understanding of the physiology of plant adaptations to the space environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Multiple bioreplicates</head><p>Both PS and PRR included two experimental runs or bioreplicates. Although the replicates for each spaceflight were carried out back to back in the same hardware, and from the same flight builds, we detected run to run variation in responses. Run to run variation may be caused by other spaceflight related conditions that could differ on a day to day basis on the ISS. While this disparity did not overshadow the major transcriptional changes that were conserved between the PS and PRR experiments, it could be misleading if results from only a single experiment are considered. This underscores the importance of being able to conduct replicate spaceflight experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Combined OMIC approaches</head><p>We acknowledge that single-time-point studies are snapshots of "steady-state" transcriptional profiles which, on their own, are not sufficient to capture the full range and continuum of regulation. However, single-time-point transcriptional studies are valuable in that they can help identify key transcriptional regulators and they offer the first signs of pathways which may be altered. The inclusion of sRNA profiling in combination with RNA-Seq can provide clues on an additional layer of post transcriptional regulation and upcoming spaceflight experiments are likely to incorporate both these forms of analyses. While the proteome may be a more direct readout of response, spaceflight experiments frequently have insufficient amounts of tissue for large scale proteomic studies; additional hurdles include the cost and the paucity of well annotated reference protein databases. Only a few flight experiments to date, have taken a proteomic approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Ferl et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mazars et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Zhang et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Kruse et al., 2020)</ref>, and fewer still have been able to include both proteomic and transcriptomic analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kruse et al., 2020)</ref>. Moving forward it will be important to employ multiple OMICs approaches to study a spaceflight experiment. The larger plant habitats on the ISS such as Veggie and the Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) can better support these endeavors. Ultimately, the biochemical and metabolic status of the plants will be indicative of their adaptations to their new environment.</p><p>Writingoriginal draft, Data curation, Formal analysis.
