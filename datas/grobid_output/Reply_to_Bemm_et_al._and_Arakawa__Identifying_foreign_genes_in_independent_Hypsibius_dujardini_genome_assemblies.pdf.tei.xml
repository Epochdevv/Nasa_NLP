<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Our report <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> describing the discovery of extensive horizontal gene transfer in a tardigrade genome has raised questions from other groups who were sequencing the Hypsibius dujardini genome in parallel or who have done new experiments and analyses since our report <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. Bemm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> now report filtering our data for likely contaminants, resulting in a new, prefiltered genome assembly. <ref type="bibr">Arakawa (3)</ref> has sequenced genomes of starved, washed, individual animals that had been treated with antibiotics for 48 h, and used this genomic sequence and RNA-Seq data to identify likely bona fide tardigrade contigs. Two other reports have contributed data and analysis: Delmont and Eren (4) used a newly published analysis and visualization platform, Anvi'o <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>, to identify likely contaminants in our genome assembly, and Koutsovoulos et al. ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) applied useful taxon-annotated GC coverage plots (Blobplots) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref> to our data and reported an independent genome assembly.</p><p>Before discussing the robustness of our finding of extensive horizontal gene transfer in tardigrades, we first note that we mistakenly uploaded an outdated version of our assembly to public databases. This assembly was 252 Mb, larger than the 212.3-Mb assembly that we had used in our report <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>, as pointed out correctly by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. The 212.3-Mb assembly used in our report is available at the link provided below. The originally uploaded 252-Mb assembly includes ∼40 Mb of sequence that we had identified as microbial contamination (see methods detailed at <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response">https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response</ref>). This mistake may have contributed to discrepancies and issues raised by others. For example, Bemm et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> identified 39 Mb of untrusted assembly, similar to the ∼40 Mb we filtered. Similarly, Delmont and Eren (4) identified whole bacterial genomes in our 252-Mb assembly, which were already largely filtered out in our 212.3-Mb assembly. We apologize to other groups for this mistake.</p><p>A central finding of our original report (1) is a high rate of foreign genes in the H. dujardini genome, which has been argued by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref> to be an artifact of incomplete filtering of contaminating microbial sequences. The availability of these other groups' independent assemblies and multiple filtering approaches [via k-mer selection (2) or GC% and coverage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>] allows us to test the robustness of our conclusions. Because any metric used will have its own particular strengths and weaknesses, we used three different approaches: (i) employing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) index ( <ref type="formula">8</ref>), (ii) identifying genes that align to prokaryotic but not eukaryotic sequences, and (iii) identifying a base level of HGT, i.e., "class C" genes as defined by Crisp et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref>.</p><p>Using the HGT index, we find that 3.8-7.1% of genes in these independent H. dujardini assemblies appear foreign (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref>). Examination of genes with prokaryotic but not eukaryotic alignments resulted in the identification of 164-384 genes (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). Class C genes in various H. dujardini assemblies range from 2.5% to 4.6% (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>). For each of these metrics, the proportion and/or number of foreign genes found in H. dujardini is substantially elevated compared with typical animals (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</p><p>In favor of these foreign genes not being contaminants is the fact that, in these independent assemblies, most genes identified as foreign reside on scaffolds together with tardigrade genes. Furthermore, foreign vs. tardigrade genes from these assemblies are represented at similar proportions in the other assemblies. On the whole, these independent assemblies show robust coverage of scaffolds from genomic and RNAseq reads of four independent sequencing efforts [including cleaned, antibiotic-treated individuals (3)] (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). If these genes of foreign origin are considered to be contaminants and their scaffolds are removed, the completeness and size of each assembly is severely affected.</p><p>Together, these data suggest that H. dujardini is likely to have an elevated level of foreign genes, most likely acquired by HGT rather than being artifacts of remaining contaminants. The level of HGT that we infer remains higher than in most animals that have been tested (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>), although not as high a level as we had originally concluded <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>It has been suggested that many foreign genes in the H. dujardini genome might not be functional or might be contaminants because RNAseq reads do not map to some of these genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref>. However, it is well documented in the literature that many HGT genes are expressed at low levels or, in some cases, are not expressed at all. For example, it is known that essentially the entire Wolbachia genome has been transferred into the genome of Drosophila ananassae, yet only ∼2% (28/1,206) of these horizontally acquired genes are transcribed at detectable levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. Follow-up investigations confirmed extensive HGT into the nuclear genome of this Drosophila species but failed to detect biologically relevant expression of any foreign genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. Thus, although identification of an expressed foreign gene could be viewed as evidence in favor of HGT, lack of expression alone is not a criterion for disproving HGT. We speculated that HGT might be important for tardigrade biology, but we restricted our analysis to HGT rather than functional HGT <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. The RNAseq datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5)</ref> will aid in assessing potential functions of these genes.</p><p>We acknowledge that different groups have concluded different proportions of HGT in the H. dujardini genome and that different metrics will give different estimates for the proportion of foreign genes in the genome. We have our own concerns about some of the methods used by other groups to exclude genes from our assembly (see <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response">https://github.com/Hd-tg-genome/PNAS_response</ref>), but we appreciate that the work of multiple groups is moving the science forward rapidly. All genomes are iterations, and we fully expect that new data and new technologies will refine this genome much as they have for the human genome and others. The true proportion of HGT may well lie between the various current estimates and may best be resolved with new sequencing technologies and bioinformatic and phylogenetic approaches.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.
