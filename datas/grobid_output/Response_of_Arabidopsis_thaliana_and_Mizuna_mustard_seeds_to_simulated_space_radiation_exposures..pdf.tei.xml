<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One of the major concerns for long-term exploration missions beyond the Earth's magnetosphere is consequences from exposures to solar particle event (SPE) protons and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). For long-term crewed Lunar and Mars explorations, the production of fresh food in space will provide both nutritional supplements and psychological benefits to the astronauts. However, the effects of space radiation on plants and plant propagules have not been sufficiently investigated and characterized. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two different compositions of charged particles-simulated GCR, and simulated SPE protons on dry and hydrated seeds of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the crop plant Mizuna mustard [Brassica rapa var. japonica]. Exposures to charged particles, simulated GCRs (up to 80 cGy) or SPEs (up to 200 cGy), were performed either acutely or at a low dose rate using the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility at Brookhaven National Lab (BNL). Control and irradiated seeds were planted in a solid phytogel and grown in a controlled environment. Five to seven days after planting, morphological parameters were measured to evaluate radiation-induced damage in the seedlings. After exposure to single types of charged particles, as well as to simulated GCR, the hydrated Arabidopsis seeds showed doseand quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions causing more severe defects. Seeds exposed to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had significant, although much less damage than seeds exposed to heavier and higher linear energy transfer (LET) particles. In general, the extent of damage depends on the seed type.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>A long-duration mission to Mars will require humans to live in space for up to 2.5 years. The distance of Mars from Earth changes with planetary physics limiting launch opportunities and preventing resupply. Consequently, food may have to be sent years ahead of the crew. Shelf-stable food systems may be five years old by the end of the mission. Under expected ambient storage conditions, critical nutrients and quality factors may degrade over this period of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>. This possibility creates a critical risk to the provision of adequate food and nutrition to support crew health and performance through such missions. Food crops grown in-mission have the potential to supplement crew nutritional requirements and to act as a psychological countermeasure for the crew by providing a familiar aspect of Earth in the isolation and confinement of deep space <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. However, seeds and plant growth supplies may also have to be sent ahead of the crew and would need to remain viable for the length of the mission. Deep-space radiation is one of the major factors that could impact the viability of food crops.</p><p>Deep-space radiation is composed primarily of protons released from large solar particle events (SPE) and galactic cosmic rays (GCR). GCR consists of approximately 85-90% protons, and 10-13% helium ions (alpha particles), with the remaining 1-2% consisting of high atomic number and energy (HZE) nuclei particles and electrons <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. For future missions back to the Moon or on to Mars, astronauts and other organisms onboard these deep space missions will be exposed constantly to GCR and occasionally to protons from SPEs. Life on Earth is well protected from these components of deep-space radiation for two reasons: (1) the Earth's global magnetic field deflects energetic charged particles, and (2) Earth's atmosphere interacts with them resulting in attenuated energy levels and secondary particles <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. However, during a mission beyond low Earth orbit (LEO), living organisms will be exposed to more intense deep-space radiation, in addition to secondary particles generated by the shielding materials, the atmosphere, and regolith if near the Lunar or Martian surface.</p><p>During a long-term deep space mission, it is expected that crew members in space will be exposed to 1-2 mSv/day dose equivalent rate of GCR and approximately half this amount on planetary surfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Even though the flux levels of GCR particles are very low, GCR contains high linear energy transfer (LET) particles that produce intense ionization as they penetrate through matter. Compared to low LET radiation (e.g., gamma radiation), the estimated average biological effectiveness (or the quality factor) of radiation received on the Martian surface and during transit are 3.05 and 3.82, respectively, primarily due to the Martian atmosphere <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. The effective Mars atmospheric shielding is about 21 g/cm 2 , which is much thicker than the spacecraft shielding of the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)'s Curiosity Rover during its transportation from Earth to Mars <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. For Lunar missions, there is no atmospheric shielding effect. Using data obtained during the MSL mission, it was estimated that a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 Sv would be experienced during a round trip Mars surface mission consisting of a 180-day transit (each way) and 500 days on the Martian surface with solar activity similar to that of 2011-2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. For plant seeds, these dose equivalent rates and quality factors may not be applicable because they refer to the biological effectiveness of a given absorbed dose of a specific type of radiation based on human tissue responses. Therefore, in this study, we designed the experiment based on the measurements of the absorbed dose during the MSL mission, which is 400-560 µGy/day during transit and 170-250 µGy/day on the Martian surface at the Gale crater region <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</p><p>At the cellular level, radiation induces DNA damage, which to some extent is successfully handled by cellular repair machinery. To counteract DNA damage, a network of cellular pathways, defined as the DNA damage response (DDR) network, mitigates DNA damage by detecting and repairing DNA lesions. These mechanisms consist of cell-cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis. The basic DDR networks in prokaryotes and eukaryotes are similar, but significant differences exist in the radiosensitivity among different species and the mechanisms that allow access to the lesions by repair enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Plants share many features of chromatin organization and DNA repair with fungi and animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>Numerous studies have shown that the effect of ionizing radiation on plants depends upon species, cultivar, development stage, tissue architecture and genome organization, as well as radiation features, e.g., quality, dose, and duration of exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Plant seeds have been flown on the ISS and on other venues beyond LEO <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, however, the radiation environment reported in most of these published studies is not comparable to deep-space Life 2022, 12, 144 3 of 18 radiation, neither in quality nor quantity. Therefore, whether crop seeds, plant growth, and produce quality are significantly affected by long-term exposure to deep-space radiation has yet to be adequately investigated and characterized.</p><p>Although current Earth-based radiation facilities can only approximately reproduce the space-radiation environment, recent improvements in technology can be utilized to improve our knowledge about the effect of space radiation on crop plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This information would in turn address the question of whether fresh food production could provide an important nutritional and psychological contribution on long-duration missions. In this study, two types of plant seeds were included. The first were seeds from Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism that does not have properties that would contribute to a bioregenerative or food capability, but which is currently the most extensively studied plant in spaceflight <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> partially due to the availability of its whole genome sequence and a wide range of genetically modified strains. The second were seeds from an edible mustard plant, Mizuna, Brassica rapa var. japonica, which has been identified as a candidate space crop and grown for research and crew consumption on the International Space Station (ISS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Seeds from both species were irradiated, and subsequently planted and grown to seedlings to demonstrate the impact of the space radiation environment on seeds and their ability to germinate and develop. The range of outcomes between Arabidopsis and Mizuna indicates the potential challenges with transferring model organism information to usable systems, and a need to focus research on crops most likely to contribute to spaceflight missions.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Plants</head><p>Seeds of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0, and Mizuna (Brassica rapa var. japonica), a mustard leafy green, were used for this study. Arabidopsis thaliana has been widely used as a model plant organism for microgravity research. Arabidopsis seeds were obtained from in-house culture, while Mizuna seeds were purchased from Johnny's Selected Seeds (Waterville, ME, USA).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Radiation Scenarios</head><p>Selected radiation scenarios are summarized in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. Seeds, dry or imbibed, were exposed to protons and titanium ions individually, or using two simulated GCR scenarios (GCR1 or GCR2) and one simulated SPE event. For both GCR scenarios, ions including protons, helium, oxygen, titanium or silicon, and iron were sequentially delivered. GCR1 was a complex mixed radiation field with a similar spectrum of particles identified in GCR. This simulation was designed by Dr. Hada's team and generated after the above primary beams passed through 20 g/cm 2 aluminum and high-density polyethylene at 10.345 g/cm 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. Under the GCR1 environment, seeds were exposed to a mixture of nondirectional secondary particles in which 250 MeV/n protons predominated <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. The GCR2 scenario was a standard GCR simulation scenario provided by the NSRL physics team for space-radiation risk assessment research without the shielding material <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Simulated SPE exposure was achieved using sequential exposures to protons with a broad energy range of 50-150 MeV/n, simulating the August 1972 SPE event <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. Exposures to all radiation scenarios were conducted acutely (within minutes for each single beam, leading to a total of about 20 min. for all particle components) or at a relatively low dose rate (LDR) over a 2-4 h time period (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Preparation of Seeds for Irradiation and Growth Study</head><p>Mizuna seeds were sanitized by 1 h-hypochlorite fuming (30 mL bleach: 0.5 mL HCL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, while Arabidopsis seeds were sanitized using a standard 70% ethanol method <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Sanitized dry seeds for each condition were then transferred to packets prepared from sterile germination paper. For imbibed seed treatments, twenty-four hours before irradiation, 0.9 mL of water was added to each packet to imbibe the seeds, and seed packets with imbibed seeds were then wrapped with several more layers of brown kraft paper sheet to prevent light exposure. All the seed packets, each containing about 25 dry or imbibed seeds, were kept in the dark at approximately 4 • C in a refrigerator, except during the periods of actual or sham (i.e., for controls) radiation exposures when both irradiated and control seed packets were still in the dark, but at room temperature.</p><p>Depending on the experimental conditions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>), 26-72 dry or 24 h-imbibed Arabidopsis and Mizuna seeds were subject to each radiation exposure treatment, while similar numbers of seeds were retained as non-irradiated controls for comparison with acute or LDR irradiated seeds.</p><p>For evaluating germination and early seedling development, two days after irradiation, control and irradiated seeds were planted onto a 0.5% Murishige and Skoog (MS) phytogel media either individually within a pipette tip holder (titanium, proton, and GCR1 experiments) or six to twelve seeds within a 10 cm × 10 cm Petri plate (GCR2 and SPE experiments) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). Growth conditions approximating those on the ISS (except for CO 2 concentration) were maintained in a controlled environment chamber (22 • C, 40-45% RH, 150 µmol•m 2 •s -1 light, ambient CO 2 at about 400 ppm, 16 h/8 h photoperiod). Seedlings were harvested at 6-7 days after planting (DAP) for Arabidopsis, and 5 DAP for Mizuna for morphological analyses. Images were acquired for evaluating signs of stress and deformation. Seeds were defined as having germinated upon observation of any early sign of germination, including seed coat rupture and radicle emergence. For purposes of assessing viability rates in seeds exposed to Ti-ion exposure, non-germinated seeds as well as germinated seeds without cotyledons, or with radical emergence or showing severely deformed cotyledons without sign of true leaf development were considered non-viable. Imagery analysis for determining cotyledon deformation was conducted only for Ti-ion irradiated Arabidopsis seedlings and mizuna experiments. In the titanium-ion irradiation experiment, deformation data were obtained for all seedlings; however, root length measurements for several seedlings were missing due to their roots being broken during the harvest. As a result, the number of plants available for analysis of root length was fewer than the number with deformation data for the titanium-ion experiment. Root length was measured using Rootnav v1.8.1 and Image J software. Root length data are presented in millimeters.</p></div>

Briefly, a simulation volume is defined, and its base is irradiated by n tracks. The number of tracks is determined from sampling of the Poisson distribution, p(n) = λ n e -λ /n!, where λ = φA is the average number of tracks, A is the area of the irradiated volume surface, and φ is obtained from a given dose D using the well-known equation, D(Gy) = 1.6 × 10 9 φ(cm -2 ) × LET(keV/µm).</p><p>(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">)<label>1</label></formula><p>The LET of a particle is calculated using the Bethe's equation, with corrections <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. To mimic the contributions of energy deposition from electron tracks of neighboring volumes, periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) were used. Briefly, the electrons that leave the irradiated volume are put back on the opposite side, with the same energy and direction vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Statistical Analysis</head><p>For discrete outcomes, such as viability, germination or deformed cotyledon counts, Fisher's exact test was used to compare radiation exposure methods (control, acute, or low-dose rate) or to compare doses within each radiation scenario. For comparisons with root length as an outcome, quantile regression was used to compare medians, taking into account the possibility of non-germination and the generally left-skewed distribution of root lengths even if germination had occurred. For defining median root length, nongermination was treated as a length of zero. In other words, a median length of x 0 is taken to mean 50% of plants had root lengths &gt; x 0 , while the other 50% either did not germinate or if they did, had lengths &lt; x 0 .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Effect of Titanium Ion and Proton Exposure on Imbibed Arabidopsis Seeds</head><p>Irradiation of imbibed Arabidopsis seeds was delivered acutely (within minutes), or over a longer duration at a low dose rate (LDR) of 0.166 cGy/min for 40 cGy 300 MeV/n titanium ions (Ti), or 40 cGy 250 MeV/n protons. Mathematical simulations showed that the fluence of these particles over an Arabidopsis embryo reached 1750 to 2000 hits/seed for titanium ions (approximately 0.5 hits/cell) and over 800,000 hits/seed for protons (approximately over 200 hits/cell). Examples of simulated Ti, proton, and simulated GCR1 and 2 particle tracks within the volume of one cell (12 µm × 12 µm × 12 µm) are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Exposure to titanium ions had no significant effect on the germination rate, however viability clearly was degraded after irradiation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref>, left panel). In addition, there were obvious increases in the percentage of cotyledon deformation in the irradiated groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2A</ref> right panel, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2D</ref>).

Therefore, for the SPE simulation, we used the model developed by the NSRL based on combining characteristics of two large historical events, namely the fluence of the August 1972 event along with an energy spectrum similar to the March 1989 event <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.

These dose points allow us to determine potential dose response and compare it with the GCR effects. Our study investigated two fundamental questions: (1) whether deep space GCR or SPE protons impacts plant seeds and their growth, and (2) which factors such as species, dose, dose rate, particle type, or some combination of these produce the most detrimental effects. Seeds received either acute exposure within 10-15 min (40-50 mGy/min), or relatively LDR exposures (1.66-3.33 mGy/min and 4.44 mGy/min for GCR and SPE, respectively). Due to facility constraints, the resulting LDR dose for simulated GCR is higher than the dose rate in deep space, but chronic exposure is more relevant in deep-space scenarios than is acute exposure.</p></div>

This experimental condition was developed to maintain the seeds in a hydrated, but still relatively dormant stage, to avoid the influence of environmental fluctuations that might interfere with the seeds' responses to radiation. In particular, temperature can affect both the germination process and DNA repair efficiency. Another factor is the light level that hydrated seeds are exposed to before, during, and after irradiation. Light regimes have been shown to dictate the specific activation and efficiency of some DNA repair pathways such as recombination or photo-repair in various plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.

However, morphological changes, especially on root length measurements, of the seedlings cultured from irradiated seeds were found to be dose-and quality-dependent, suggesting that heavier ions cause more severe damage (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">7</ref>).

There have been several long-duration exposures of seeds to the space environment using different platforms such as the Materials International Space Station Experiment (MISSE) facility, the EXPOSE facility, and the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF). MISSE and EXPOSE are multi-user facilities designed to operate outside of the ISS. The LDEF was deployed to low-Earth orbit (LEO) at approximately 250 nautical miles in 1984 and had orbited the Earth for about 5.7 years. It was retrieved in 1990 at about 178 nautical miles. At present, MISSE and EXPOSE are still operational. The reports of these studies are not quite consistent. In a 27-month EXPOSE-R experiment stationed outside the ISS, analysis of the germination results revealed that the tomato seeds did not survive the exposure to radiation with or without UV. Arabidopsis seeds survived only in a dark layer shielded from UV exposure and were able to germinate and further develop <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>. In another report from Tepfer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, the EXPOSE-R exposure (without UV) significantly reduced the germination rate of seeds from two wild type Arabidopsis lines: Columbia (Col-0) and Wassilewskija (Ws-2), with Ws-2 showing more sensitivity to space radiation exposure than Col-0. DNA degradation was found in the seeds exposed to UV, but not significantly in those shielded from UV exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. In contrast, under a different space environmental condition in the LDEF flight, tomato seeds maintained at a controlled climate of 14 psi with 15% humidity at an altitude between 175 to 275 nautical miles only showed that the pores of the strophiole region of the flight seeds were larger in size than those in the ground control seeds, which might affect germination <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</p><p>For other space radiation related research platforms, in a very recent experiment using the Cosmic Ray Exposure Sequencing Science (CRESS) payload system, a 1U CubeSat design, Arabidopsis seeds (under 1 atm) were exposed to the stratosphere (36-40 km) environment above Antarctica in a 30-day, long-duration high altitude balloon mission <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. In a parallel experiment, dry seeds were exposed to a 40 cGy GCR1 simulation at NSRL. GCR and stratosphere exposed seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates of 76.4% and 82.5%, respectively compared to 98% for the controls. Significantly elevated somatic mutation rates (and developmental aberrations) were also revealed in these GCR or stratosphere exposed seeds with the GCR exposure generating significantly higher mutation rates than that of Antarctica. These mutations also resulted in the death or delayed growth of certain plant organs. Heritable mutations were found in the second generation of the GCR irradiated seeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. DNA damage, degradation, and mutation are the major findings of radiation impacts on seeds and plants in many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>. Further investigations are needed to fully characterize DNA damage and DNA damage repair in response to space radiation, as well as the multigenerational effects.</p><p>In addition to flight studies, numerous ground radiation studies have been conducted using ground-based radiation sources. Many of these studies did not target space exploration but aimed to evaluate impacts of radiation accidents on the environment, as well as using radiation as a tool to generate desired mutations to benefit agriculture. Among these studies, those conducted in highly contaminated radiation background areas at a dose rate relevant to deep space are particularly of interest. Many studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of chronic low-dose rate exposure on biological organisms including plants. Some have reported significant genotypic and phenotypic changes in plants within the exclusion zone with a relatively low dose-rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</p><p>In general, our findings are in agreement with these studies, and by using ground based GCR and SPE simulations, we provided further evidence that space radiation exposures affect both dry and imbibed seeds.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions and Future Work</head><p>In our study, we have confirmed for the first-time ground-based simulation of GCR and SPE has an impact on Arabidopsis and Mizuna seeds. We observed dependence of outcome measures on dose, dose rate, and radiation quality, with heavier ions causing more severe damage. Exposures to simulated GCR (dry seeds) and SPE (hydrated seeds) had much less effect compared to exposures to heavier and higher LET particles, but there were significant impacts that appear to be dependent on the seed type. As expected, hydrated seeds were more sensitive to radiation exposure than were dry seeds.</p><p>Complementary to the results we presented here, it is very important to understand the cellular and molecular basis of these findings. Numerous parameters can be evaluated in future studies to provide deeper insights in the mechanisms behind these reported findings, from analyzing relative sizes and cellular organization of the apical meristem and elongation zone, to conducting multi-omics analyses. Plant DNA damage response and repair mechanisms in response to space radiation also need to be fully characterized. To this end, we are currently conducting an RNAseq analysis using the harvested seedling samples from this study. In addition, we are in the process of evaluating the degree to which GCR and SPE radiation exposures affect the ability of seeds of mizuna, lettuce, and tomato to develop into adult plants and edible fresh produce.</p><p>In space, plant seeds are exposed to multiple space environmental factors, such as altered gravity, suboptimal growth conditions including water stress, high CO 2 and environmental volatile organic compound (VOC) levels, ethylene generation, and altered air pressure that may cause stress and impact plant growth. Furthermore, plants developed from sanitized seeds may be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens from the unique microbiome of a transit vehicle. The space radiation environment may further impair the ability of seeds and plants to adapt to these environmental challenges during long-duration missions. In order to support successful integration of fresh food production systems in future spaceflight missions, studies need to be conducted to understand radiation impacts on a wider variety of space crop candidates and other developmental stages in the plant life cycle, such as young seedling growth, embryogenesis, and seed maturation. More studies are also needed to identify physical or biological methods that efficiently protect or repair seeds from deep space radiation.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
