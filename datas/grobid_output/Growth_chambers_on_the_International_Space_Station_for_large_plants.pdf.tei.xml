<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Planning long-term space flights necessarily includes issues of providing food for the crew. One of the areas of research is the development of technologies for independent production of food by the crew. Extensive research on lettuce has confirmed that the "space production" of lettuce is not inferior to that on Earth, even in the absence of gravity, but the same deep understanding of the quality of grain crops has not yet been achieved. Therefore, the goal of our work is to establish whether the conditions for growing wheat in outer space without gravity affect the weight and basic parameters of the grain, and whether this leads to increased asymmetry of the kernel and distortion of the starch composition. The objects of the study were wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) kernels of the Super Dwarf cultivar. Of which, 100 kernels matured in outer space conditions in the Lada growth chamber on the International Space Station (ISS), and 85 kernels of the control wheat grown in a similar growth chamber under terrestrial conditions. It has been established that kernels from ISS have significant differences to a smaller extent in weight, area, length, and width of the kernel. However, the kernels under both conditions were predominantly large (the average weight of a kernel in space is 0.0362 g, and in terrestrial conditions-0.0376 g). The hypothesis that the level of fluctuating asymmetry will increase in outer space was not confirmed; significant differences between the options were not proven. In general, the kernels are fairly even (coefficients of variation for the main parameters of the kernel are within 6-12%) and with a low or very low level of asymmetry. The length of starch granules of type A in filled and puny kernels is significantly greater in kernels from ISS than in the control, and in terms of the width of starch granules B and roundness indices, both experimental variants are the same. It can be assumed that the baking qualities of earthly kernels will be slightly higher, since the ratio of type B starch granules to type A is 5-8% higher than on the ISS. Also, the width of the aleurone layer cells in mature kernels was significantly inferior to the result obtained on Earth. The work proposes a new method for establishing the asymmetry of kernels without a traumatic effect (in early works, it was supposed to study asymmetry in transverse sections of the kernels). Perhaps this will make it possible to further develop a computer scanning program that will determine the level of asymmetry of the wheat fruit.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results</head><p>The wheat plants obtained during the full-size experiment on the ISS and in the ground laboratory Lada greenhouse were harvested after reaching the full maturity stage. The kernels were husked from the ears, weighed, and stored under the same conditions. To determine the natural range of differences, visually determined parameters were assessed. At the same time, it was found that some of the kernels were larger in size and had a fully formed shape; some had signs of stunting, namely an uneven and asymmetrical shape. This scatter is typical for kernels formed on spikelets in different zones of the ear, wherein well-filled kernels were formed in the spikelets of the central part of the ear, and puny kernels were formed in the upper and lower parts.</p><p>Another morphological phenomenon that needed to be taken into account was the presence of a through hole in some of the kernels, probably associated with unknown variability and peculiarities of the formation of the middle part of the endosperm. This feature can be noted for part of the grains as a characteristic feature both for kernels of Super Dwarf wheat grown in the field, and for kernels of wheat grown in Lada greenhouses under the conditions of a ground experiment and in low-Earth orbit under the conditions of the ISS. This hole was observed in both well-filled and puny kernels, that is, these signs were not related. The identified natural fluctuations of the signs of "puny/well-fulfilled" and the "presence/absence of a through hole" were taken into account when analyzing kernels and forming a sample for analysis.</p></div>

Granules of type B are more aligned, for example, the variability in the width of puny kernels was 46% for granules of type A, and half as much for granules of type B (21%). The indices of the length and width of type A granules for kernels from the ISS and from Earth are the same-11 and 14% for mature kernels, and 12 and 11% for puny ones.

Also, the length and width of type B granules in puny kernels from Earth were significantly smaller. The roundness indices are the same within all types of granules, as well as the width of type A granules.  The ratio of starch granules type A and B affects the baking properties of flour. An analysis of the ratio of granules showed that in kernels from the ISS there is 5% less type B starch in mature kernels than in the control ground variant, as well as in puny kernels-the difference with the Earth is 8% (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). In general, the distribution of the two types of granules in kernels from the Earth treatment was close to an equal ratio, but in kernels from the ISS there was a significant bias towards type A granules.

However, the width of the cells in mature kernels from the ISS was significantly smaller (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref>). When analyzing the qualitative characteristics of starch granules, median sections differing in shape, aspect ratio, and the presence of extensions in the central part of the kernel were used. The ratio of sizes, number of starch granules of various types, and their location are associated with varietal characteristics, predicted flour quality, cultivation characteristics, and the presence of pests. Due to the fact that under space flight conditions, as in laboratory conditions, the main control indicators such as humidity, lighting, nutrition were the same, and pests and diseases were not identified, it can be assumed that the differences could be caused by the specific location of the greenhouse. The shape, the ratio of the number of starch granules, as well as the binder and matrix, which is the remains of the cytoplasm, are indicators of the quality of the resulting flour and starch.</p><p>The starch granules in the endosperm of the kernels had a structural organization characteristic of wheat. Large starch granules were inclusions formed in plastids and they formed a flat spindle-shaped structure, which was expressed in depressions located along the widest part. Smaller grains are also formed in plastids and their quantity affects the quality of starch and, therefore, flour. The forming granules in fully completed kernels under terrestrial conditions had a smooth surface with a depression on the side and smaller starch inclusions of type B. In kernels that have impaired development and pronounced asymmetry of the two sides, apparently associated with the peculiarities of formation, lack of nutrients, local disruption of the supply of nutrients, some disturbances in the shape, and ratio of starch granules deposits could be observed.</p><p>Under cultivation conditions in ISS, small changes in shape in the granules, and significant disturbances in the quantity, ratio of granule types, and sizes in granules with an uneven and incompletely formed system of deposition of reserve substances was observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">6</ref>). A breakdown of the binding components could also be observed.  Plants 2024, 13, 73 9 of 20</p></div>

The Lada chamber was carefully designed so that the main difference between the treatments was gravity. The ISS-grown plants appeared visually normal, likely because phototropism responses under both treatments were similar. Since no major morphological changes in plant growth were observed, the accumulative effects of gravity were evaluated in the kernels produced under the two treatment conditions. Because the experiment could not be replicated, detailed studies were conducted to determine if differences between kernels produced in the two environments exist. However, the nature of those studies was restricted by both small sizes and non-damaging evaluations. It has been found that the simple scanning of a scattering of kernels is not suitable for a non-traumatic method of asymmetry determination. The presence of asymmetry can be detected by measuring the length of the left and right parts of the kernel, scanning (or photographing under a microscope) the base of the kernel. That is, of the two proposed methods, only the second is suitable-measuring the lengths of perpendiculars to the axis of symmetry through the point of attachment of the kernel and the zone of closure of the two lobes of the kernel. It was found that the weight, area, length, and width of the kernels from the plants grown in the ISS are less than those in the ground control, with statistically identical perimeters and roundness. Hypothesis A, that all parameters would be significantly lower, was put forward, but the hypothesis was only partially confirmed. A similar phenomenon was observed in a study of Arabidopsis seed coats-the size and number of cells inside the seed coat were statistically the same <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, as well as the number of lettuce leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Also, Plants 2024, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr">73</ref> the hypothesis regarding the distortion of the shape of the kernel (Hypotheses B and C) were not confirmed, although early studies mentioned various types of deviations, for example, chromosome breakage <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, inability to produce seeds <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, distorted and nonviable embryos <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and morphological abnormalities <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. This might be due to improved systems for growing plants-improved ventilation and watering systems.</p><p>There are usually two types of starch granules in wheat kernels-A-type and B-type. They vary in size, shape, and composition. Thus, A-type starch granules have a biconvex shape; their size is more than 10 µm and they contain more amylose than B-type granules. The second type of granule is typically round in shape and size &lt;10 µm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Granules are widely present in the starchy endosperm of the kernel, where they are located within a protein matrix. In our study, this was also confirmed by the granule roundness indices. We have found that the length of starch granules in kernels from the ISS was significantly longer than that from accessions in the terrestrial treatment. Perhaps, this can be partially explained by the reaction of plants to small doses of stress, as was shown in the work with the influence of low salt concentrations on kernel parameters <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</p><p>The baking properties of wheat are closely related to the composition (two types of glucose polymer, amylose, and amylopectin), structure, and morphology of starch granules, as well as storage proteins (gliadins and glutenins) of the grain, which determine the viscoelastic properties of the dough <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. In mature endosperm, protein content is higher at the periphery of the kernel and decreases towards the central part (kernel cavity), and starch granules accumulate in exactly the opposite direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. In a number of studies, the kernel was divided into nine successive layers (pearling method) and confirmed that differences in the spatial distribution of chemical components affect the quality of flour. Thus, bread from layers 3-6 had a higher loaf volume, specific volume, elasticity, and organoleptic characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>. Our study revealed that there are more type B granules in terrestrial experience; that is, it can be assumed that kernels from the ISS will be slightly inferior in baking quality. Also, changes in starch content under the conditions of space were reported in works on the seeds of Brassica rapa <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, pepper plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and on the roots of the watercress Lepidium sativum L. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</p><p>The cells of the aleurone layer are rich in protein and triacylglycerols <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. In our work, in the ripened wheat grains on the ISS, the width of the aleurone layer cells was significantly smaller in matured wheat kernels from the ISS (Hypothesis D was confirmed) than in the terrestrial experiment; therefore, they like have less of the protein component. Reduced protein levels in Brassica rapa seeds obtained under space station conditions were previously reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. Also, Arabidopsis thaliana seeds had 54.73% fewer protein bodies than the ground control <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Researchers believe this is due to the harsh conditions of microgravity, such as increased ethylene content. The lack of natural ventilation in growth chambers can easily lead plants to oxygen starvation <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> and, as a consequence, to seed hypoxia. Some symptoms of oxygen deficiency are a reduction of protein bodies, abnormal deposition of starch granules, and thickening of cell walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</p><p>When analyzing the qualitative differences between kernels obtained on Earth and in the ISS, both symmetrical and asymmetrical kernels were used with an emphasis on the starch inclusions of the endosperm, which are an indicator of the quality of starch and flour for wheat. No significant differences were found in the size and arrangement of starch grains in fully developed symmetrical kernels grown both on Earth and in space flight conditions. However, differences were observed both in the connecting elements of cytoplasmic residues and in the size, location, and ratio of A and B starch inclusions in kernels with manifested asymmetry. It can be argued that if optimal conditions are created under which developmental disorders will be absent, the quality of grain and flour will not differ from those on Earth. It is possible that the cause of this phenomenon may be the peculiarities of the manifestation of the physical properties of water in weightlessness, which do not allow us to completely simulate this phenomenon. Thus, the availability of water for plants and the technical device for its provision can be key indicators for yield obtaining under space flight conditions. This is confirmed by the changes in the epidermis and hairs on the surface that we described earlier <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</p><p>In the future, prospects are seen in accelerating the determination of the asymmetry of kernels by introducing computer scanning and developing a system for placing grains in a vertical position. We also consider it promising to study the relationship between the chemical composition of the seeds and the asymmetry of the fruits using hyperspectral and computer scanning methods. The small differences in kernel characteristics observed in two treatments to which wheat plants are poorly adapted, constant temperature, 24 h light, and low gravity, suggests that wheat cultivars better adapted to non-earth conditions would be relatively easy to breed. Such plants would be better adapted to space conditions and would not require some genes involved in resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. Because some of the genes used to limit crop losses on the earth do have adverse effects on plant vigor.</p></div>

This variety (CMH79.481-1Y8B-2Y-2B-OY) was selected by Dr. Bruce G. Bugbee in 1984 at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico, because the variety showed high adaptive potential to hydroponics, high CO 2 content, and artificial lighting <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Super Dwarf plant heights are 15-20 cm in the field and 25-30 cm in growth chambers, making it attractive for growing in space bioregenerative life support systems.

Wheat kernels of the same cultivar Super Dwarf, obtained in a similar Lada chamber in the ground laboratory, served as a control.

The kernels of each option were individually poured from paper bags onto the scanning surface of an Epson Perfection V550 Photo scanner, and the kernels were covered with black thick paper on top. The distance between the kernels was increased or decreased so that they did not touch, and their shadows did not creep onto each other when processed in ImageJ v2023. Wherein, the kernels were not turned over. Images were acquired at 600 dpi resolution. The kernel may fall onto the scanning surface sideways or onto the area where the two sides of the endosperm meet (crease), taking into account the uneven balance of weight inside the kernel. If it falls to one side, it will not be possible to establish asymmetry, since the symmetry line of the crease will not be reflected correctly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_30">13</ref>).

The significance of the differences between the control sample and kernels from ISS was determined using the t-test method in SPSS Statistics 25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">Calculation of Asymmetry Indicators</head><p>The direction of asymmetry was calculated as the ratio of the length of one of the sides to the sum of the lengths of the left and right sides <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. For example, the direction of asymmetry from the vertices of the lobes to the axis of symmetry (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_29">3</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">4</ref>) was found as L1/(L1 + L1'). All calculated values of indices of directions were in the range from 0 to 1. An index of 0.5 indicates symmetry of the sides, and so, with an assumption of 5%, it can be assumed that indices of 0.48, 0.49, 0.51, and 0.52 also indicate symmetry. Calculated values from 0 to 0.48 show a shift of symmetry to the left, and values from 0.53 to 1 are considered to be right-directed. If 3-5 indices out of 5 have the same direction, then we take this direction as directionality, for example, 3 indices are left-directed, 1 index is rightdirected, and 1 more indicates symmetry, then we consider the kernel to be left-directed. The direction of asymmetry to the left was found to be characteristic of kernels that were located on the right in a simple ear <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>Indices of relative asymmetry and fluctuating asymmetry of kernel were calculated using the previously applied method <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. The relationship of asymmetry indices with the main parameters of kernel was assessed using the Spearman rank correlation method in SPSS Statistics 25.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6.">Comparison of Asymmetry Indices Obtained Using Both a Kernel Section and a Non-Traumatic Method</head><p>Early studies showed that the sufficient sample size to establish the asymmetry of kernel was 15 kernels per variant <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In present work, 20 kernels per variant were used (ISS and control), including two groups-kernels with a hole between the point of attachment of the kernel and the radicle and without such a hole. The selection of kernels was carried out randomly due to the function in SPSS "formation of a random sample of a given size". Samples with serial numbers selected by the program were cut in the middle across the kernel. Relative asymmetry indices, asymmetry directional indices, and the value of fluctuating asymmetry were determined <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Comparison of indices from the kernel section and using a non-traumatic technique was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney method in SPSS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.7.">Scanning Electron Microscopy</head><p>Microscopy of the kernels was performed using a Camscan scanning electron microscope (Cambridge Instruments, Cambridge, UK). The kernels were placed on a metal stage, treated with a thin layer of gold and palladium, and then photos of the endosperm were taken using a scanning electron microscope (10 nm, ×1000). Using the resulting photographs, the length and width of starch granules on sections of kernels and on cut prints (starch granules are separate from each other) were measured. Using the resulting photographs, the length and width of starch granules on sections of kernels and on prints of sections (starch granules are separate from each other) were measured. Forty kernels were studied, of which 10 kernels were filled kernels from the ISS, 10 kernels were puny kernels from the ISS, and 20 kernels were from Earth experiment. On each kernel, five photographs were randomly taken with magnification of 1000 and 1500 times. The normality of the distribution was checked by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov method, and the means were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance.</p></div>

This, coupled with the built-in scanning technology and auxiliary camera, overcomes the complex problems encountered with conventional hyperspectral cameras, such as external longitudinal scanning mechanism and difficult focus.</p><p>Spectral range: 400-1000 nm, spectral resolution above 2.5 nm, 300 spectral channels. The image resolution was 1920 × 1920. Every 10 measurements, calibration measurements were taken on a white calibration panel coated with BaSO 4 .</p><p>Image analysis was carried out using Gelion software (Gelion 1.0b.sh., Moscow, Russia-gelion.agro.msu.ru). Analysis of the approximation of the spectral curve of kernels to the reference values of the spectral profiles of the coloring substances of the kernel, specifically in this case anthocyanins (AnC) were analyzed, identified by the type of the spectral curve-the dependence of the spectral brightness on the wavelength. At the same time, the reference spectra were brought to a single brightness scale-reflection coefficients. Reflectance coefficient (r) is the ratio of reflected radiation to incident radiation in the direction perpendicular to the surface. The reflectance in a certain direction relative to the Earth's surface is called spectral albedo.</p><p>The NDVI index (normalized relative vegetation index)-a simple indicator of the amount of photosynthetically active biomass-was calculated using the formula (800 nm -680 nm)/(800 nm + 680 nm). Vegetation index values range from 0.20 to 0.95.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The work presents, for the first time, data on the asymmetry of wheat kernels obtained in near space conditions, and also indicates the relationship of this parameter with other important characteristics of the kernel. It has been found that there were no significant differences between the main parameters of the kernels from the wheat plants grown on the ISS and on Earth. The number of type B starch granules in kernels from ISS was 5-8% less than in those obtained on Earth, and the width of the cells of the aleurone layer in kernels from ISS was significantly inferior to that obtained on Earth. Despite the fact that many parameters of the grains were statistically the same, a decrease in the protein component in the endosperm indicates a likely increase in stress components, gravity loss, water stress, and possibly some tissue hypoxia during the formation of space generation seeds; therefore, the growth chambers should be modified for better aeration.</p><p>It should be noted that growing plants from seeds in space opens up prospects for sustainable food production and the stability of artificially created ecosystems not only during long space flights, but also in other closed-cycle conditions; for example, when creating stationary systems with extreme conditions on other planets, at base stations in the Arctic and Antarctic, high mountain areas, or at underground or underwater objects. The data presented make it possible to obtain valuable information about the asymmetry of the shape, protein, and starch composition of the kernel in the space environment. Continued research in this area will contribute to the development of space agriculture and the creation of a self-sustaining space habitat. The phototropic responses of plants are likely the main factor preventing drastic gravitational responses in space.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
