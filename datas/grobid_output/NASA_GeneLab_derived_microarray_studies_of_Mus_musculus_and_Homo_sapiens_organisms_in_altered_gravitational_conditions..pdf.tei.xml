<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>One of the greatest challenges of humanity for deep space exploration is to fully understand how altered gravitational conditions affect human physiology. It is evident that the spaceflight environment causes multiple alterations to musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, immune and central nervous systems, to name a few known effects. To better characterize these biological effects, we compare gene expression datasets from microarray studies found in NASA GeneLab, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository. In this review, we summarize these archived results for various tissues, emphasizing key genes which are highly reproducible in different mice or human experiments. Such exhaustive mining shows the potential of NASA Open Science data to identify and validate mechanisms taking place when mammalian organisms are exposed to microgravity or other spaceflight conditions. Our comparative meta-analysis findings highlight certain degrees of overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed within musculoskeletal tissues in each species across a variety of altered gravity conditions. However, the level of overlap between species was found to be significantly limited, partly attributed to the limited availability of human samples.</p><p>NASA GeneLab platform, part of the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR; <ref type="url" target="https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio">https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio</ref>) constitutes an omics (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) interactive open-access database where users are able to upload, download, share, store and analyze data from spaceflight and space-relevant experiments. Approximately half of the datasets in the GeneLab repository consist of transcription profiling assays. The most prevalent transcription study assay type is microarray with RNA sequencing data being the fastest-growing assay in the database. Other assay types include genome sequencing, protein expression, metabolite profiling, epigenomics, metagenomics, and epitranscriptomics 1,2 .</p><p>There are still many unknown mechanisms regarding the biological effects taking place during spaceflight. Discovering these mechanisms is essential for NASA's goal to keep its astronauts healthy, especially with the planned human deep space exploration missions, which are near the horizon. From the very first space missions, it became evident that microgravity causes physiological changes to mammals, including significant abnormalities presented in the cardiovascular, immune, vestibular and musculoskeletal systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> . There are multiple and intricate hazards to human health and performance in spaceflight caused by a combination of environmental stressors such as gravitational alterations, ionizing radiation, high level of carbon dioxide, changes in diet and physiological stress. Appropriate countermeasures must be developed in order to effectively minimize the aforementioned impairments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> . Due to the small size of the astronaut cohort and privacy concerns surrounding human data collection and sharing, most spaceflight data originate from model organisms rather than Homo sapiens. An example of a model organism is Mus musculus, a suitable model for studying the effects of altered gravitational conditions. Current knowledge of the effects of spaceflight is derived from experimental models in vivo, ex vivo (e.g., tissue) and in vitro (e.g., cell culture) 8 .</p><p>Opportunities for actual microgravity experiments are rare and challenging to access due to the infrequency of spaceflights and the various associated restrictions, including expenses, equipment requirements, and the need for volunteers. Thus, space analogs, such as random positioning machines, clinostats, head-down bedrest, hindlimb unloading rodent</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>Review of effects of altered gravitational conditions on Mus musculus It has been shown that the central nervous system (CNS) of Mus musculus exhibits severe abnormalities after exposure to spaceflight. For example, neuroinflammation has been identified following ionizing radiation individually or combined with microgravity exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> . Santucci et al. (OSD-33, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/7btg-6q49">https://doi.org/10.26030/7btg-6q49</ref>) studied the effects on gene and protein expression level in mouse brain tissue following a 3-month mission on the International Space Station (ISS). They found that the expression of nerve growth factor (Ngf) was decreased in hippocampus, cortex and adrenal gland during spaceflight conditions, whereas brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) did not show consistent changes across the brain regions and the adrenal gland. Both proteins are involved in learning and memory via regulating neural plasticity. Genes related to various metabolic and catabolic processes were downregulated as well, while proteins related to mitochondrial and calcium metabolism, synthesis and hydrolysis of ATP, and amino acid transportation were upregulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . Frigeri et al. (OSD-32, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/jpyz-fn46">https://doi.org/10.26030/jpyz-fn46</ref>) performed mRNA expression analysis in brain tissue of mice that were hindlimb-unloaded for 2 weeks. Hindlimb unloading (HU) is a microgravity analog in which a rodent's hind limbs are suspended and in disuse. Genes related to the transport of small molecules and ions into cells were upregulated in the HU group. An increased risk of venous thrombosis, as well as changes in functional pathways such as immune response, learning and memory performance, and cell junction were also noted <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . Holley et al. (OSD-536, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/bg5q-t229">https://doi.org/10.26030/bg5q- t229</ref>) highlighted significant alterations in gene expression profiles associated with neuronal function, immune regulation, growth and metabolic function in brain tissue of mice that were housed on the ISS for thirty-five days. In particular, genes supporting neuronal synaptic signaling and migration were significantly downregulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</p><p>The detrimental consequences of microgravity exposure on the musculoskeletal system have also been extensively documented. Fitzgerald et al. (OSD-232, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/9626-w275">https://doi.org/10.26030/9626-w275</ref>) studied articular and sternal cartilage from mice that had experienced spaceflight conditions for 30 days. Genes that encode structural extracellular matrix components, such as Fmod, Ogn, Omd, Dcn, Dpt, Prelp, Col10a1, Tsp4, and Comp were downregulated in articular cartilage. Proteoglycan levels were lowered in the spaceflight articular cartilage, while there was no proteoglycan loss in the sternal cartilage. The authors concluded that this is because in microgravity, articular cartilage experiences near-complete biomechanical unloading, but sternal cartilage still experiences biomechanical loading <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . Gambara et al. (OSD-135, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/rjyq-x751">https://doi.org/10.26030/rjyq-x751</ref>) found that in longissimus dorsi from mice flown for 30 days on the BION-M1 biosatellite, genes linked to insulin sensitivity and metabolism of skeletal muscle were significantly dysregulated, while myofiber cross-sectional area and myosin heavy chain subtype patterns were not altered <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . Chakraborty et al. (OSD-396, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/ce4f-xx71">https://  doi.org/10.26030/ce4f-xx71</ref>) examined the procedure of bone fracture healing (using a segmental bone defect model) in mice housed on the ISS for 4 weeks. Micro-computed tomography (μCT) analysis of callus tissue after spaceflight indicated increased trabecular spacing and decreased trabecular connectivity, while an apoptosis and cellular morbidity gene-network signal was activated in the spaceflight callus tissue compared to controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> . Gambara et al. (OSD-111, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/9580-9n52">https://doi.org/10.26030/9580-9n52</ref>) assessed changes in gene expression in mouse soleus and extensor digitorum longus following 30 days on the BION-M1 capsule. They identified differentially expressed genes related to key biological processes such as contractile machinery, calcium homeostasis, muscle development, cell metabolism, and inflammatory and oxidative stress response <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Based on data from the same mice, Blottner et al. studied the Homer gene, which is thought to be downregulated during muscle atrophy. They found the short Homer1a isoform was upregulated, while the long Homer2 isoform was downregulated in the soleus muscle after microgravity exposure. This isoform sensitivity appears to be regulated by muscle activity or inactivity at the neuromuscular junction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . Däpp et al. (OSD-228, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/bfmx-z866">https://doi.org/10.26030/bfmx-z866</ref>) examined transcriptome alterations in soleus tissue of mice that underwent hindlimb suspension (HLS). HLS is a microgravity analog in which a rodent's hind limbs are suspended, resulting in disuse similar to microgravity exposure. They found increased myogenic factors, contractile genes, and metabolic genes during reloading, as well as indications that sarcomere regulation is sensitive to mechanic loading <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . Flück et al. recommended that especially in tissue plasticity studies, we should normalize gene expression levels using tissue-relevant references (e.g., muscle weight, volume, nuclear content) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Mazzati et al. (OSD-227, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/vk0m-0558">https://doi.org/10.26030/vk0m-0558</ref>) also used HLS to detect differential expression of genes associated with lipid and glucose metabolism in soleus and gastrocnemius tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Allen et al. (OSD-21, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.25966/c36b-3g68">https://doi.org/10.25966/c36b-3g68</ref>) stated that spaceflight significantly alters expression of gastrocnemius tissue genes that are associated with muscle growth (e.g., phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulatory subunit p85a, MAFbx/atrogin1, insulin response substrate-1, and forkhead box O1 transcription factor) and muscle fiber type <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</p><p>Furthermore, weightlessness causes a decrease in bone formation by osteoblasts and an increase in osteolytic functions of osteoclasts. Pardo et al. examined gene expression profiles of 2T3 preosteoblast cells to find genes particularly sensitive to gravity changes, and found that simulated microgravity downregulated alkaline phosphatase, run-related transcription factor 2, osteomodulin and parathyroid hormone receptor 1, while cathepsin K was upregulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Patel et al. (OSD-30, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.25966/90vx-bf79">https://doi.org/10.25966/90vx-bf79</ref>) compared preosteoblast exposure to two different simulators of altered gravity: Rotating Wall Vessel and Random Positioning Machine. They found similar results from each method, including altered expression of the same 14 skeletal remodeling genes. In particular, they found inhibited alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity in both, demonstrating that both methods inhibit preosteoblast differentiation, consistent with microgravityinduced bone mass decrease. Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PthR1) involved in calcium mobilization and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) associated with skeleton development (e.g., cartilage formation) were downregulated in the Rotating Wall Vessel conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . The role of parathyroid hormone-related protein was also studied by Camirand et al. (OSD-107, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/2x2z-6w28">https://doi.org/10.26030/2x2z-6w28</ref>) using trabecular and calvarial cells. They confirmed that PthR protein has anti-apoptotic function under microgravity, and as a result it could be defined as an anabolic agent to prevent cell death in trabecular osteoblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . Uda et al. (OSD-324, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/s7kj-h383">https://  doi.org/10.26030/s7kj-h383</ref>) studied altered gravity effects on osteocytic cell line Ocy454 for 2, 4 and 6 days onboard the ISS, concluding that glucose metabolism and oxygen consumption were increased during spaceflight <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Wang et al. (OSD-547, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/y2af-c498">https://doi.org/10.26030/y2af-c498</ref>) examined gene expression profiles of osteocyte-like cell line MLO-Y4 under simulated altered gravitational conditions via large gradient high magnetic field, showing that this environment affected the expression of genes related to enzyme, peptide, G-protein coupled receptors and glucose metabolic process <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . Sambandam et al. (OSD-18, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.25966/j6hy-d340">https://doi.org/10.25966/j6hy-d340</ref>) investigated the differentiation procedure of osteoclasts using a rotary cell culture system to simulate microgravity. In particular, they highlighted increased expression of genes associated with enhanced osteoclast differentiation and function, such as cytokines/growth factors, proteases and signaling proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</p><p>Osteoblast precursors such as Bone Marrow Stromal Cells (BMSC) are sensitive to mechanical loading. Monticone et al. (OSD-29, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.25966/6rr8-r017">https://doi.org/  10.25966/6rr8-r017</ref>) studied murine BMSC cultures that were onboard the ISS for 8 days, while half of them were stimulated with osteo-inductive <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-024-00392-6">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41526-024-00392-6</ref> medium. They found that cell proliferation was inhibited in spaceflight conditions and that differentially expressed genes were related to neural development, neuron morphogenesis, transmission of nerve impulse and synapse <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . Ortega et al. (OSD-50, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/69kd-nx87">https://doi.org/10.26030/69kd-nx87</ref>) differentiated murine bone marrow cells (mBMC) in the presence of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rM-CSF) for 14 days during spaceflight, detecting significant increase in cell proliferation and differential expression of genes related to the coagulation pathway. They found that the macrophages that differentiate during spaceflight express slightly different markers, and that the post-spaceflight population may be slightly more differentiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . In addition, Chapes and Ortega (OSD-50, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/69kd-nx87">https://doi.org/  10.26030/69kd-nx87</ref>) highlighted the importance of ground-based experiments before spaceflight in order to assess macrophage differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> .</p><p>Astronauts suffer from skin dryness, itching, coarsening of epidermis and decreased skin elasticity. Neutelings et al. (OSD-61, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/2zjp-sj35">https://doi.org/10.  26030/2zjp-sj35</ref>) reported a fifteen percent reduction of dermal thickness of cutaneous tissue collected from mice exposed to spaceflight conditions for 90 days. They also reported deregulated hair follicle cycle and upregulated myogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . Mao et al.

(OSD-4, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.25966/qq9p-pc28">https://doi.org/10.25966/qq9p-pc28</ref>) reported alterations in the expression of genes regulating stress, T-cell signaling activity and glucocorticoid receptors following the exposure of mice to spaceflight for 13 days. In particular, Rbm3, Ctla-4, IFN-a2a genes were upregulated and Hsph110, Hsp90aa1, Cxcl10, Strip1, Fkbp4m, and CD44 genes were downregulated in the thymus tissue of spaceflown mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> .</p><p>Beheshti et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> utilized the NASA GeneLab database to analyze transcriptomic data from different rodent datasets (e.g., OSD-4, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.25966/qq9p-pc28">https://doi.  org/10.25966/qq9p-pc28</ref>, OSD-21, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.25966/c36b-3g68">https://doi.org/10.25966/c36b-3g68</ref>, OSD-25, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.25966/kzxa-s692">https://doi.org/10.25966/kzxa-s692</ref>, OSD-48, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/jq04-0n51">https://doi.org/10.  26030/jq04-0n51</ref>, OSD-61, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/2zjp-sj35">https://doi.org/10.26030/2zjp-sj35</ref>, OSD-63, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/gsmt-8e70">https://doi.org/10.26030/gsmt-8e70</ref>, OSD-111, <ref type="url" target="https://doi.org/10.26030/9580-9n52">https://doi.org/10.26030/  9580-9n52</ref>), revealing critical genes, signaling pathways and circulating micro-RNA signatures as key biomarkers for astronauts' health. Particularly, they identified TP53 and transforming growth factor beta one (TGF-β1) as the most prevalent regulators across all tissues, and TGF-β1 was the most connected gene across all tissues, suggesting it is a key driver gene for spaceflight response <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34</ref> .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparative analysis of microgravity effects on musculoskeletal systems</head><p>We present a differential gene expression analysis in response to microgravity vs control conditions. To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions we generated volcano plots per each tissue which depict both the statistical significance and the level of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In addition to that, we evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the top over-expressed and underexpressed genes.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> shows volcano plots of all musculoskeletal mouse muscle microarray datasets from OSDR. These plots show the variation and diversity of differential gene expression results even between the same types of muscle.

Similar to the mouse datasets, there is widespread variation in both distribution and differentially expressed genes between datasets of the same tissue type.</p><p>We then evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly upregulated in four or more mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Fbxo32, Cdkn1a, Lcn2, Pnmt, Fkbp5, and Cebpd (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). We also evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly downregulated in four mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Col1a1 and Dbp (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). We performed a similar analysis using all datasets from human musculoskeletal tissue (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>).</p><p>We further expanded the analysis by incorporating all available data from literature derived from the same tissue and organism, utilizing similar experimental conditions, without imposing any specific inclusion criteria (e.g. P value, log2-fold change). Consequently, we proceeded with the computation of Pearson correlation coefficients for all these genes across experiments that evaluated comparable factors. First, we investigated the concordance of gene expression levels between two male human bedrest experiments studying vastus lateralis tissue (OSD-195 and OSD-370). The most notable difference between these two datasets is that OSD-195 studied 21 days of bedrest while OSD-370 studied 9 days of bedrest. The correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the gene-by-gene relationship between the two datasets. Our analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation with a coefficient of 0.47. This indicates that there is a tendency for the gene expression levels to increase together across the two experiments.</p><p>We extended our investigation to include the OSD-51 experiment, female human bedrest study which shared 1225 common unique genes with both OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments from the larger merged list of 17,402 genes. For OSD-51 compared to OSD-195, a correlation coefficient of 0.26 was observed, indicating a weak positive correlation between the gene expression levels of the two experiments. Similarly, between OSD-51 and OSD-370, a correlation coefficient of 0.23 was found, also indicating a weak positive correlation. However, notably, the correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments was significantly higher, with a coefficient of 0.64, even using the reduced number of genes, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This suggests that these two experiments exhibit more similar gene expression patterns when compared to OSD-51. The increase in correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370 compared to the larger merged dataset (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>).</p><p>We then examined the correlation coefficient between two mouse gastrocnemius datasets (OSD-21 and OSD-227), focusing on 12,385 unique common genes. The greatest difference between these two experiments is that OSD-21 studied female mice flown on an 11-day space shuttle flight while OSD-227 studied male mice subjected to hindlimb suspension for 24 h. The calculated correlation coefficient was close to 0.2, falling within the range of a weak positive correlation.</p><p>We also calculated the correlation coefficient between OSD-227 soleus and OSD-111 soleus, where OSD-111 studied male mice flown on the BION-M1 biosatellite for 30 days. The Pearson correlation coefficient calculated for the shared genes between OSD-111 and OSD-227 was found to be 0.02 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>). This correlation coefficient indicates minimal linear relationship between the gene expression patterns in the two experiments.</p><p>Overall, we observe higher correlation coefficient between datasets which studied subjects of the same sex under similar experimental conditions. Several factors can contribute to the correlation coefficient, including biological variability, technical factors, and the complexity of gene expression regulation. Even with the same tissue and similar experimental conditions, gene expression can exhibit considerable variation between samples and experiments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Studies from spaceflight and ground analog experiments confirmed that altered gravity environment causes multiple physiological alterations to both mouse and human musculoskeletal, immune, cardiovascular, vestibular, integumentary, and nervous system, including biological processes such as metabolism of skeletal muscle, bone formation response, inflammatory response, apoptosis and cell proliferation in PBLs, impaired activation of T cells, stem cell differentiation, cell cycle disruption in hair follicles, neuron morphogenesis, neuronal synaptic signaling and migration, cell morphology and diverging cell cycle in cancer cell lines.</p><p>In our study, we initially incorporate all available literature data derived from the same tissue and organism with similar experimental conditions, without considering specific inclusion criteria. Subsequently, we computed Pearson correlation coefficients for all genes across experiments that evaluated comparable factors. Initially, we focused on Homo sapiens' Vastus lateralis tissue. The analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation indicating a tendency for gene expression levels to increase together across OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments. We expanded our investigation to include the OSD-51 experiment. We observed a correlation coefficient of 0.26, showing a weak positive correlation between the gene expression levels between OSD-51 vs OSD-370, and OSD-51 vs OSD-195. However, the correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370 experiments was notably higher, with a coefficient of 0.64, suggesting a more pronounced association and similarity in gene expression patterns when compared to OSD-51. The increased correlation between OSD-195 and OSD-370, despite a reduced number of common genes, indicates potential biologically relevant similarities between these two experiments, which may not be evident when considering the larger gene set. The calculated correlation coefficient between experiments regarding Mus musculus Gastrocnemius and Soleus tissues indicated weak positive and close to zero correlation, respectively. Furthermore, we were interested in characterizing how reproducible these experimental results are within each species. We focused on the musculoskeletal system for a comparative analysis because this physiological system contains the greatest number of comparable tissue types between human and mouse datasets. We evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly upregulated in 4 or more mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Fbxo32, Cdkn1a, Lcn2, Pnmt, Fkbp5, and Cebpd. This analysis revealed a consistent trend of  Genes with a log2-fold change above 1 are represented in red, signifying upregulated expression, while genes with a log2-fold change below -1 are depicted in blue, indicating downregulated expression. The horizontal dashed line corresponds to the adjusted P value threshold of less than 0.05, highlighting genes with statistically significant expression changes. upregulation of several biological processes including protein binding, ubiquitin activity and transferase activity in mouse muscle tissues exposed to microgravity. We also evaluated the Gene Ontology functions of the genes that were significantly downregulated in two mouse musculoskeletal tissues across experiments: Col1a1 and Dbp. This analysis shows consistent downregulation of several biological processes across experiments, including metal ion binding, DNA binding and RNA polymerase activity. Interestingly, several of the same biological processes were found to be associated with both upregulated genes and downregulated genes.</p><p>We performed a similar analysis using all datasets from human musculoskeletal tissue (Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). There were fewer datasets to compare, and three upregulated and nine downregulated genes overlapped between    datasets. The CHRND gene (associated with acetylcholine binding, acetylcholine receptor activity, acetylcholine-activated cation-selective channel activity, ligand-gated ion channel activity), CHAD gene (related to protein kinase inhibitor activity), and RRAD gene (associated with GTP binding, GTPase activity, calmodulin binding, protein binding) were significant upregulated on two different human experiments, OSD-195 and OSD-370 both studying vastus lateralis tissue. The aforementioned experiments also share nine common downregulated genes MYOZ2 (associated with actin, and protein binding), COLQ (associated with protein binding), along with KLHL40, CA14, CASQ2, KLHL34, ACOT11, COQ10A, and PPP1R1C. Overall, in the human musculoskeletal datasets we find consistency in the biological process of protein binding. OSD-195 and OSD-370 have the greatest overlap, even though the other two datasets also studied the same tissue type.</p><p>It was challenging to perform a direct comparison between the human and mouse results, due to the small sample size in the human datasets. However, we did note that the protein binding Gene Ontology term was related to several upregulated mouse and downregulated human genes.</p><p>We assess gene expression results from a variety of tissues in both Mus musculus and Homo sapiens exposed to altered gravity in spaceflight or ground analogs. We report some overlap and reproducibility in genes identified as differentially expressed in musculoskeletal tissues within each species, and very limited overlap between species, partially due to the small amount of human samples. To ensure the comprehensiveness of our analysis, we took an inclusive approach by incorporating all relevant literature data derived from the same tissue and organism, with similar experimental conditions. This inclusive approach may help to identify potential patterns or trends across a wider range of studies, which may not be apparent when focusing solely on a subset of data. The elevated correlation observed between OSD-195 and OSD-370, despite a reduced number of shared genes, implies the presence of potential biologically relevant similarities between these two experiments. Further research is needed to understand which differentially expressed gene signatures from Mus musculus are truly reflective of Homo sapiens response to altered gravity.</p></div>

Academic research databases, such as PubMed, and ScienceDirect were also used with the keywords "microgravity and microarray", "spaceflight and microarray", "gravity and microarray" and "weightlessness and microarray".
