<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Root gravitropism relies on gravity perception by the root cap and requires tightly regulated phytohormone signaling. Here, we isolate a rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponics but normal gravitropic growth in soil. We identify COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (CRW1) encoding an ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)-BINDING F-BOX PROTEIN (OsEBF1) as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype. We show that the OsCRW1-EIN3 LIKE 1 and 2 (OsEIL1/2)-ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR 82 (OsERF82) module controls the production of reactive oxygen species in the root tip, subsequently impacting root cap stability, polar localization of PIN-FORMED 2 (OsPIN2), symmetric distribution of auxin, and ultimately gravitropic growth of roots. The OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 ethylene signaling module is effectively impeded by applying gentle mechanical resistance to root tips, including growing in water-saturated paddy soil. We further show that mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling is required and sufficient for antagonizing the ethylene signaling pathway. This study has revealed previously unanticipated interplay among ethylene, auxin, and mechanosensing in the control of plant gravitropism.</p></div>

In the nucleus, the core ethylene response transcription factors ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/ EIN3-Like proteins (EILs) activate the transcription of specific downstream genes in response to ethylene-inducing stress events <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . When the stress signal fades and the ethylene level goes down, EIN3/EILs are degraded by the EIN3-BINDING F-box protein 1/2 (EBF1/2) mediated ubiquitination/ proteasome pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</p><p>Although ethylene is indispensable for plants, high level of ethylene is adverse for root growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> . In compacted soil, diffusion of ethylene away from roots is limited, resulting in the accumulation of ethylene and inhibition of root penetration into the soil <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . Ethylene inhibits root elongation by interacting with other plant hormones, such as auxin and abscisic acid <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> .

Excess ethylene also weakens root gravitropic response by affecting auxin biosynthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . In addition, some auxin signaling and transport mutants exhibit both defective gravitropic phenotypes and insensitivity to ethylene <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . However, the specific mechanism whereby ethylene signaling controls gravitropic growth remains unclear.</p><p>In this study, we isolated an intriguing rice mutant that displays root coiling in hydroponic culture but normal gravitropic growth in soil. The mutated gene represents a loss-of-function allele for the EIN3binding F-box protein OsCRW1/OsEBF1, leading to overaccumulation of the OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and amplified ethylene signaling. We show that OsEIL1/2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82, which subsequently regulates the transcription of several genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Overaccumulation of ROS in the root tip leads to premature loss of the root cap structure, impaired polar localization of OsPIN2 and auxin distribution, resulting in severely impaired gravitropism. In the soil-grown plants, however, gravitropism is restored in a mechanosensing-induced calcium signaling-dependent manner, revealing an intricate regulation of gravitropism by crosstalk between ethylene signaling and mechanosensing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results crw1 roots coil in water but not in soil</head><p>We screened an ethyl methylsulfonate-mutagenized population (approximately 5000 lines) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivar Zhonghua11 and isolated a mutant with root coiling phenotype when grown in hydroponic culture (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, Supplementary Movie 1). Both seminal and adventitious roots of the mutant coiled in the root tip region, resulting in a shorter root depth compared to the wild type (WT, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Changes in nutrient supply, solution pH, aeration (dissolved oxygen level), and exposure to light did not alter the root coiling phenotype of the mutant in hydroponic culture (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). When grown in water-saturated solid media (e.g. paddy soil, soil-vermiculite mixture, vermiculite and peat pellet), however, the root coiling phenotype disappeared (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>). We named the mutant coiling root in water (crw1).</p><p>In contrast to the distinctive root phenotype, shoots of crw1 grew normally in hydroponics (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). Plants were grown to maturity in two paddy fields. In one paddy field, no significant difference was observed between crw1 and WT in any of the agronomic traits determined at plant maturity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c-h</ref>), whereas in the other field there was a small and significant reduction in the percentage of filled grains and grain biomass per plant in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4i-n</ref>).</p><p>crw1 exhibits smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and defective gravitropic response in hydroponic</p><p>The coiling phenotype of crw1 suggests that it may be a gravitropic mutant. Compared with WT, crw1 had a smaller root cap (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>) and fewer amyloplasts in the root tip (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). When roots were placed horizontally, crw1 responded less sensitively to gravity than WT and started to coil at 6 h after horizontal placement (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>, e and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>), indicating impaired gravitropic response.</p><p>Auxin distribution is crucial for root gravitropism <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . To examine the auxin distribution in the root tip, we introduced the auxin reporter DR5rev::VENUS into WT and crw1. When grown in water (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>), WT roots showed symmetrical auxin distribution, whereas crw1 showed asymmetric auxin distribution at different stages of coiling (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1g</ref>). When WT roots were placed horizontally, gravity triggered rapid accumulation of auxin on the bottom side of the root tip, causing it to grow towards the gravity direction; once the root tip grew in the gravity direction, symmetrical auxin distribution was restored (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6a</ref>). In contrast, crw1 exhibited an asymmetric auxin distribution at all stages under gravitational stimulation (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6b</ref>). As expected, asymmetric auxin distribution led to asymmetric cell length on the two sides of the root tip (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a-c</ref>). Compared to WT, crw1 had a shorter meristem and fewer meristem cells (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7d</ref>, <ref type="figure">e</ref>). Staining with 5-ethynyl-2deoxyuridine (EdU) showed a lower proliferation of meristem cells in crw1 than WT (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7f</ref>, <ref type="figure">g</ref>). Applying the auxin biosynthesis inhibitor L-Kynurenine (L-Kyn) or removing the root cap resulted in a more even auxin distribution (indicated by DR5rev::VE-NUS) and rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>).</p><p>In Arabidopsis thaliana, symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip is maintained by the auxin exporter PIN2, which is polarly localized on the top of the root epidermal cells to allow the shootward flow of auxin from the root tip <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> . This pattern of polar localization is conserved in seed plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . To examine the localization of OsPIN2 in the root tip, we introduced OsPIN2-GFP driven by its native promoter (pOsPI-N2::OsPIN2-GFP) into WT and crw1 by crossing. OsPIN2-GFP was polarly localized in the epidermal cells in WT, whereas such polarity was lost in crw1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1h</ref>), which is consistent with the asymmetric auxin distribution observed in crw1 root tips.</p><p>When grown in soil, all phenotypes of the mutant, including root coiling, root cap size, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and gravity response, were rescued to similar levels observed in WT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>-h and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water is caused by a smaller root cap size with fewer amyloplasts and asymmetric auxin distribution resulted from OsPIN2 mis-localization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cloning the causative gene of crw1</head><p>To clone the causal gene for the crw1 phenotype, we backcrossed WT (paternal) with crw1 (maternal). All F 1 plants showed the straight-root phenotype in water (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9a</ref>), and the F 2 progeny segregated into 340 and 119 straight and coiling-root, respectively, which is consistent with a 3:1 ratio (χ 2 = 0.002, P = 0.966) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9b</ref>), indicating that the root coiling phenotype of crw1 resulted from recessive mutation of a single gene. We conducted genomic resequencing mapping and Mut-Map analysis on the F 2 progeny and identified three candidate genes, Os06g0604400, Os06g0605900, and Os06g0619600 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9c</ref>, <ref type="figure">d</ref>). Complementation tests identified Os06g0605900 as the causative gene for the mutant phenotype, which we name COILING ROOT IN WATER 1 (OsCRW1) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a-d</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9e</ref>, <ref type="figure">f</ref>). Compared to WT, a 3681-bp fragment deletion was identified in the promoter and a portion of the open reading frame of crw1 allele, resulting in a total loss of transcription (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of OsCRW1 (oscrw1 KO ) in WT also generated the same root coiling phenotype in water, which disappeared in soil (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>, f and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10a</ref>). The three oscrw1 KO lines also showed smaller root caps and asymmetric auxin distribution in the root tips when grown in water, and these defective phenotypes were rescued when plants were grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>).</p><p>Analysis of transgenic plants expressing pOsCRW1::GFP and pOsCRW1::GUS showed that OsCRW1 was expressed in both roots and shoots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>, h and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>). In roots, OsCRW1 was strongly expressed in root tips, especially in the root cap (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2g</ref>, <ref type="figure">h</ref>). Transient expression of p35S::GFP-OsCRW1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCRW1 was localized in the nucleus (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2i</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Elevated ethylene response in crw1 when grown in hydroponic</head><p>OsCRW1 encodes an F-box domain containing protein (OsEBF1), a homolog of the Arabidopsis EIN3-binding F-box protein 1 (AtEBF1) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . Recent studies showed that OsEBF1 and OsEBF2 negatively control ethylene signaling like AtEBF1 and AtEBF2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref>  exogenous ethylene <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> , and a decreased resistance to brown planthopper in rice <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40</ref> . To examine whether loss of function of OsEBF2 affects gravitropism, we knocked out OsEBF2 in the WT background using CRISPR/Cas9. No effect on root growth and gravitropism was found (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). Knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not exacerbate the root coiling phenotype in water, and also did not affect the phenotype recovery in soil (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">12c</ref>, <ref type="figure">d</ref>), suggesting that OsEBF2, unlike OsCRW1/OsEBF1, does not play a role in root gravitropism.</p><p>We performed RNA-seq analysis on WT and crw1 roots grown in water or soil. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT grown in water, ethylene-responsive genes were strongly enriched, with 30 of the 32 DEGs being significantly upregulated in crw1, including 20 ethylene response transcription factors (ERFs) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). When grown in soil, the number of DEGs between crw1 and WT decreased to 5, with 2 ethylene-related genes being upregulated in crw1 compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">13</ref>). Application of 1-MCP, an ethylene response inhibitor, totally rescued the phenotypes of smaller root cap, asymmetric auxin distribution and root coiling in crw1 and three oscrw1 KO lines in water (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3c-f</ref>), suggesting that excessive ethylene response leads to the root coiling phenotype.</p><p>The above findings support the notion that OsCRW1/OsEBF1 may, like Arabidopsis AtEBF1, function in the degradation of core ethylene response transcription factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . These may include OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that are rice homologs of AtEIN3/EIL1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14a</ref>), the central transcriptional factors controlling the activation of ethylene signaling and targets of AtEBF1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> . We investigated whether OsCRW1 interacts with OsEIL1/OsEIL2 proteins. Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays showed that OsCRW1 physically interacted with OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>). We generated transgenic plants expressing pOsEIL1::OsEIL1-Flag or pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag in WT, and introduced these transgenes into crw1 by crossing. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated much higher levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 than WT when grown in water, but the differences largely disappeared when grown in soil (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>).

In contrast, WT roots grown in a highly compacted soil (bulk density = 1.6 g cm -3 ) exhibited an elevated level of OsEIL1, indicating an increased ethylene consistent with the report by Pandey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> Next, we knocked out OsEIL1 (oseil1 KO /crw1) or OsEIL2 (oseil2 KO / crw1) in crw1 by using CRISPR/Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">14d</ref>, <ref type="figure">e</ref>), which essentially rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4c</ref>, <ref type="figure">d</ref>), with the effect being greater in oseil1 KO /crw1 than in oseil2 KO /crw1. These results indicate that loss of function of OsCRW1/ OsEBF1 leads to overaccumulation of both OsEIL1 and OsEIL2, causing the root coiling phenotype in water, with OsEIL1 playing a larger role than OsEIL2. Next, we overexpressed OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter, increasing the transcription of the two genes by 16-22-and 52-57-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">16a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). When grown in water, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines showed shorter and slightly curved roots compared with WT (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">16c</ref>). Addition of a small dose of the ethylene precursor ACC (1 μM) in water decreased root growth of WT slightly but caused OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines to coil in the root tip region, a phenotype resembling crw1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">16d</ref>). Overexpression of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 alone did not cause root coiling, likely because OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 is degraded in the presence of functional OsCRW1/OsEBF1. In contrast, enhanced ethylene concentration from ACC addition may repress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and thus stabilize OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins, as has been shown in Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> . When grown in soil, the shorter and curvy roots of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 overexpressing lines were largely rescued (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">16e</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 act on the ethylene response factor OsERF82</head><p>To search for the direct target genes downstream of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 that cause root coiling in crw1, we analyzed the expression pattern of all of the 139 ERF genes from the transcriptomic data. We expected that the transcriptional levels of the target genes should match the phenotype changes, i.e. elevated in crw1 only in water but reduced in soil. When grown in water, 20 ERF genes were expressed at higher levels in crw1 roots than WT (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17a</ref>). When grown in soil, 17 of these 20 ERF genes were equally highly expressed in both WT and crw1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17b</ref>), suggesting that these 17 ERF genes may not be related to the root coiling phenotype of crw1. The three remaining ERF genes, OsERF2 (Os06g0181700), OsERF81 (Os02g0520000) and OsERF82 (Os04g0399800) were significantly downregulated in both WT and crw1 when grown in soil (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17b</ref>). These ERF genes are potential candidate genes targeted by OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 and associated with the occurrence of the root coiling phenotype (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4e</ref>). We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the three ERF genes individually in the crw1 background (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17d-f</ref>) and found that disruption of OsERF82 (oserf82 KO / crw1) rescued the root coiling phenotype of crw1 in water to a large extent (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4f</ref>, <ref type="figure">g</ref>), whereas knockout of OsERF2 or OsERF81 had no effect (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">17g</ref>, <ref type="figure">h</ref>). The OsERF82 protein was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transactivation activity (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">18a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). We used yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 could specifically bind to the EIN3-binding sites (EBS, ATGTA) in the promoter region (2.5 Kb) of OsERF82 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4h-j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">18c</ref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR of pOsEIL1::O-sEIL1-Flag/crw1 and pOsEIL2::OsEIL2-Flag/crw1 transgenic plants showed that OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 bound to the EBS sequences in the OsERF82 promoter in vivo (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4k</ref>, <ref type="figure">l</ref>). Furthermore, knockout of OsEIL1 or OsEIL2 in crw1 largely abolished the upregulation of OsERF82 expression when grown in water (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4m</ref>). Taken together, the transcription factor OsERF82 acts as a direct target of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 to amplify ethylene signaling and cause root coiling of crw1 in water.</p><p>The complete rescue of the crw1 phenotype in oseil1/crw1 but the incomplete rescue in oserf82 KO /crw1 suggests that other target genes regulated by OsEIL1 may also be involved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS nexus controls gravitropism</head><p>In addition to the ethylene signaling pathway, RNA-seq showed that genes related to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also enriched in crw1 when grown in water but not in soil (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19a</ref>), suggesting that ROS may be involved in the root coiling phenotype. Among the DEGs between crw1 and WT, a ROSresponsive gene Bsr-d1/ZFP36, a respiratory burst oxidase homolog enzyme gene (RBOHH) and four class III peroxidase genes were upregulated in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19b</ref>). It has been shown OsRBOHH is involved in ROS production in rice roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> . The Class III peroxidases are also possibly involved in ROS production in multiple and functionally redundant ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> . To examine whether ROS is involved in the root coiling phenotype, we used the ROS fluorescent probe H 2 DCFDA to monitor root ROS levels in WT and crw1 grown in water. Compared with WT, the ROS level in the root tips of crw1 was elevated dramatically, especially in the coiling region and the sloughing root cap cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>). Aeration of hydroponic solution had no effect on the ROS level in crw1 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">20</ref>). When grown in soil or vermiculite, ROS in crw1 roots returned to a low level comparable to that in WT, corresponding to the recovery of the root phenotype (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19c</ref>, <ref type="figure">d</ref>). Increased programmed cell death was observed in the root cap cells of crw1 grown in water by the TUNEL assay (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>), which was likely induced by excess ROS <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref> and explained why crw1 had a smaller root cap than WT. Application of the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 200 μM), the RBOH inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 50 nM), or the inhibitor of the class III peroxidase salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM, 10 μM) in water reduced ROS in crw1 roots to the level comparable to that in WT (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19e</ref>, <ref type="figure">f</ref>), prevented the excessive programmed cell death and sloughing of the root cap cells, and largely rescued the root coiling phenotype (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">19g</ref>, <ref type="figure">h</ref>). Furthermore, clearance of ROS restored the polar localization of OsPIN2 and symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tips of crw1 (Fig. <ref type="figure">5d</ref>, <ref type="figure">e</ref>). Taken together, these data suggest that enhanced ROS generation, likely by RBOHs and PRXs, causes root coiling in crw1 by accelerating sloughing of root cap cells and impairing OsPIN2 localization.</p><p>To establish the causal relationship between excess ROS and the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 roots, we grew WT, crw1, oseil1 KO /crw1 lines, oseil2 KO /crw1 lines, and oserf82 KO /crw1 lines in water and examined the ROS level in root tips. Knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2, or OsERF82 in crw1 decreased ROS to a similar level as in WT (Fig. <ref type="figure">5f-h</ref>), suggesting that the amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 module in crw1 leads to excessive ROS generation in the root tip. To explore how enhanced OsERF82 promotes ROS production, we found that the promoter regions (approximately 3 Kb) of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Os09g0323700, Os06g0695400 and Os07g0638600) contain potential ERF binding sites, including DRE/CRT (GCCGAC), GCC-box (GCCGCC) and G-box (CACGTG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref> (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">21a</ref>). The Yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated that OsERF82 specifically bound to the binding sites of the DRE/CRT, GCC-box and G-box in the promoter region of OsRBOHH and three Class III OsPRX genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">21b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>). Quantitative PCR showed that the transcriptional levels of OsRBOHH and the three Class III OsPRX genes were upregulated in crw1 root tips compared with those in WT (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">21d</ref>), whereas knockout of OsEIL1, OsEIL2 or OsERF82 in crw1 suppressed the upregulation of these genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">21d</ref>). Taken together, amplified OsEIL1/2-OsERF82 causes ROS accumulation in crw1 root tips likely by promoting the transcription of OsRBOHH and Class III OsPRX genes.</p></div>

These solid media were soft and had a penetration resistance of 35-67 Pa (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3a</ref>), which is 25-47 folds smaller than that in the same paddy soil unsaturated with water (moisture content 20%) and compacted to a bulk density of 1.6 g cm -3 (i.e. a condition similar to that used in the study of Pandey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> ).

We compared root growth of WT and crw1 in a paddy soil packed at a normal (1.0 g cm -3 ) and a high (1.6 g cm -3 ) bulk density. Both levels of bulk density restored the coiling root phenotype of crw1 to straight roots. At 1.0 bulk density, WT, crw1 and two oscrw1 KO mutants showed similar root length (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">25</ref>). Increasing bulk density to 1.6 decreased the root length of WT by 36% and of crw1 and two oscrw1 KO mutants by 47-51% (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">25</ref>). The larger inhibition in crw1 is consistent with the heightened ethylene signaling.</p><p>Mechanosensing rescuing crw1 phenotype requires calcium signaling in the root cap Calcium (Ca 2+ ) is a critical signal in plant responses to mechanical stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref> . To investigate whether Ca 2+ signaling is involved in the rescue of the root coiling phenotype in crw1, we expressed NES-YC3.6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref> , a cytosolic Ca 2+ ([Ca 2+ ] cyt ) reporter gene, driven by the maize Ubiquitin promoter in WT and then introduced the gene into crw1 through crossing. The root caps of both WT and crw1 growing in four different solid media showed a significantly higher [Ca 2+ ] cyt signal than those growing in water, and there were no significant differences between WT and crw1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>). Similarly, the [Ca 2+ ] cyt signal remained low in the root caps of both WT and crw1 when grown in 0.3% and 0.4% agar, and increased significantly when both were grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">26</ref>). These results suggest that a gentle mechanical resistance of approximately ≥ 34 Pa enhances [Ca 2+ ] cyt in the root cap and beyond this threshold there is no further increase in [Ca 2+ ] cyt . Moreover, loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 does not affect [Ca 2+ ] cyt in the root cap or its response to mechanical resistance.</p><p>To investigate whether the enhanced Ca 2+ signal in the root cap is involved in the recovery of crw1's phenotypes, we applied 100 μM LaCl 3 , a Ca 2+ channel blocker, to 0.8% agar. We found that LaCl 3 suppressed [Ca 2+ ] cyt in the root caps (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7c</ref>, <ref type="figure">d</ref>) and largely abolished the rescue effect of mechanical resistance on the root cap size and auxin distribution (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7e</ref>, <ref type="figure">f</ref>). Importantly, the addition of LaCl 3 abolished the recovery of the root coiling phenotype in crw1 grown in 0.8-1.2% agar (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7g</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">27</ref>), indicating the root cap calcium signal triggered by mechanosensing is required for the rescue of gravitropism in crw1.</p><p>The observation that growing in soil prevented overaccumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in crw1 roots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>) suggests that mechanosensing-Ca 2+ signaling may rescue the root coiling phenotype of crw1 by limiting the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Western blot showed that crw1 roots accumulated OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 when grown in 0.4% agar, and accumulation of the two proteins was suppressed to the WT levels when grown in 0.8% agar (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7h</ref>, <ref type="figure">i</ref>). Addition of 100 μM LaCl 3 to 0.8% agar suppressed [Ca 2+ ] cyt in the root caps, resulting in an over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 in the crw1 roots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7h</ref>, <ref type="figure">i</ref>). There were no significant differences in the transcript levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 between WT and crw1 in different agar concentrations or between 0.8% agar with and without addition of LaCl 3 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">28</ref>), suggesting that the effect of mechanosensing-induced Ca 2+ signaling on the protein levels of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 is not related to transcriptional regulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. Furthermore, upregulation of OsERF82 and excess ROS production in crw1 roots were observed when grown in 0.4% agar but not in 0.8% agar, whereas the addition of LaCl 3 to 0.8% agar medium significantly increased OsERF82 transcription and ROS accumulation in crw1 roots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7j</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">29</ref>). In WT roots, OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins were kept at low levels because of the presence of OsCRW1, which likely explains the lack of response of OsERF82 transcription and ROS level to mechano-sensing induced Ca 2+ signaling in WT. These results suggest that mechano-sensing induced Ca 2+ signaling inhibits the amplified module of OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS in crw1, and rescues the root cap structure, OsPIN2 polar localization, auxin distribution, and consequently gravitropism.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>The root coiling phenotype in hydroponics occurs in natural rice accessions</head><p>Rice roots show considerable natural variation in the growth phenotype when grown in hydroponics. During the screen of a panel of 230 rice accessions consisting mainly of landraces in the lower Yangtze River delta in China, we found that 53, 46 and 131 accessions exhibited the root coiling, straight root, and intermediate phenotypes, respectively, when grown in water (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">30a</ref>). We randomly selected 8 accessions each with coiling or straight roots (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">30b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>). Quantitative PCR showed that the group of root coiling accessions had a significantly lower level of OsCRW1 transcript than the group with straight roots (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">30d</ref>). Addition of 1-MCP to water straightened the coiling roots (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">30e</ref>), suggesting the phenotype in these rice accessions is likely caused by enhanced ethylene signaling. When grown in watersaturated paddy soil, the root coiling phenotype was completely rescued (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">30f</ref>), which is consistent with the phenotype recovery of crw1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>Ethylene plays a critical role in plant growth, development and resistance to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses. Because ethylene biosynthesis fluctuates widely under the influence of changing environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref> , its effect on gravitropic growth of roots must be tightly regulated. In this study, by dissecting the genetic basis for the root coiling phenotype in the rice mutant crw1, we uncovered the molecular module of OsCRW1 (OsEBF1)-OsEIL1/OsEIL2-OsERF82-ROS that connects ethylene signaling to gravitropism in rice roots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>). Furthermore, by addressing why growing in soft solid media rescued root coiling phenotype of crw1, we discovered an unexpected role of root cap mechanosensing in limiting excessive ethylene signaling, thereby safeguarding gravitropic growth of rice roots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">8</ref>).</p><p>The gravitropic growth of roots depends on the perception of gravity by the root cap and the symmetric distribution of auxin in the root tip. The former requires amyloplast as the gravity responder to transmit the gravity signal via LAZY proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , and the latter is tightly controlled by polar-localized auxin transporters such as PIN2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .

The impact of ethylene signaling on root gravitropism appears to vary among plant species. In Arabidopsis, loss-of-function mutations of the key genes that control ethylene biosynthesis or signal transduction, including ETO1, CTR1, EIN2, and EIN3, did not affect gravitropic growth of roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . In contrast, disruption of EIL1 and EIN2 homologous genes in rice or maize resulted in enlarged angle of adventitious roots when grown in hydroponic, indicating a weakened gravitropism <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . In the present study, we found that loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to coiling of both seminal and adventitious roots of rice in hydroponic culture, indicative of a severe disruption of gravitropism. The F-box proteins EBFs bind to EIN3 and EIL proteins, thus promoting their degradation via a ubiquitin/proteasome pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> . The loss of function of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 led to overaccumulation of OsEIL1/2 proteins in rice roots and consequently amplified ethylene signaling. We identified OsERF82, a hitherto unreported ethylene response factor, as the downstream target of OsEIL1/2. OsERF82 transcriptionally regulates the expression of several genes involved in ROS production, including OsRBOHH and several Class III peroxidase genes. The elevated expression of OsERF82 in crw1 enhanced the expression of these We found that excessive ROS accumulation in the root tip of crw1 accelerates root cap sloughing through programed cell death, thereby reducing the number of amyloplast and weakening gravity perception. Furthermore, excessive accumulation of ROS disrupted the symmetrical auxin distribution in the root tip by impairing the polar localization of OsPIN2. This is consistent with an earlier finding that application of exogenous H 2 O 2 inhibits vesicle-mediated trafficking and polar localization of AtPIN2 in Arabidopsis 54 . Disrupted polar localization of OsPIN2 and reduced root cap stability together explain the severe loss of gravitropism in crw1 roots. Thus, limiting ethylene signaling in the nucleus is critical for the normal gravitropic growth of rice roots.</p><p>Although growing in compacted soil may increase the ethylene level in roots due to restricted gas diffusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , we found that gentle mechanical resistance that rice roots typically encounter in watersaturated paddy soil or other soft solid media enhances the degradation of OsEIL1/OsEIL2 and thus dampens the excessive ethylene signaling in crw1, leading to rescue of the root coiling phenotype. The mechanical resistance required to antagonize ethylene signaling amplification is mild (penetration resistance ≥ 34 Pa), consistent with the soft nature of submerged paddy soil that rice plants are adapted to. This level of mechanical resistance is more than an order of magnitude lower than in water unsaturated and compacted soil used in the study of Pandey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> . Strong mechanical resistance can inhibit root elongation or change the direction of root growth. For example, root tips stop growing when encountering threedimensional impenetrable compactness <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , change direction to avoid a flat obstacle <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> , or grow in a wavy or circular manner on an impenetrable agar slope <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> . A recent study showed that Arabidopsis roots growing on the agar surface can produce different growth paths in response to subtle changes of mechanical forces <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> . In the present study, mild mechanical resistance did not affect the normal root growth of WT but was sufficient to ensure gravitropic root growth of crw1 and coiling-root accessions, suggesting that mechanical resistance below the level that inhibits root growth can be sensed by rice roots to help safeguard gravitropism. Such an effect has not been reported before but is consistent with previous findings that plants can sensitively perceive different strengths of mechanical stimuli from nature and produce rapid thigmonastic responses or gradual morphogenetic alterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> .</p><p>We found that the rescue of root gravitropism in crw1 by gentle mechanical resistance requires Ca 2+ signaling in the root cap. In the absence of OsCRW1/OsEBF1, mechanosensing-induced Ca 2+ signaling safeguards the gravitropic growth of crw1 roots by suppressing the accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2. How enhanced Ca 2+ signaling in the root cap prevents over-accumulation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 remains unclear and warrants further investigation. The observation that knockout of OsEBF2 in crw1 did not affect the rescue of the root coiling phenotype by gentle mechanical resistance suggests that enhanced Ca 2+ signaling promotes the degradation of OsEIL1 and OsEIL2 proteins in an OsCRW1/OsEBF1 and OsEBF2-independent mechanism. Mechanosensing-induced Ca 2+ signaling may play a particularly important role in keeping ethylene signaling in check under stress conditions, which suppress the translation of OsCRW1/OsEBF1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43</ref> , or in natural rice accessions with a weak or loss-of-function OsCRW1. On the other hand, although OsCRW1 may be dispensable in uncompacted soil, it is needed to restrict excessive ethylene signaling in compacted soil to reduce the inhibition on root growth. OsEIL1-Flag and OsEIL2-Flag proteins were detected by Flag antibody (anti-Flag) and the Actin (anti-Actin) was used as a loading control. j Transcriptional level of OsERF82 in roots by Q-PCR.

Different letters above bars indicate a significant difference at P &lt; 0.05 (two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test). Scale bars are 1 cm in (g) and 100 μm in (a, c, e, f). Data and images shown are representative results of three independent experiments with similar results. Source data are provided as a Source Data file. Interestingly, we observed that the root coiling phenotype was present in some natural rice accessions when grown in hydroponics, and the phenotype was apparently related to the transcription level of OsCRW1/OsEBF1. Some of the coiling-root accessions had a OsCRW1/ OsEBF1 transcript level similar to those in the straight-root accessions, suggesting that variation in the protein level or in the coding sequence may also be involved. Growing these rice accessions in soft paddy soil also restored their gravitropic growth. A lower level of OsCRW1/ OsEBF1 may be advantageous for stress resistance because of enhanced ethylene signaling, especially when root gravitropic growth can be safeguarded by mechanosensing. Several stress response pathways were enriched in the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crw1 and WT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3b</ref>). Among these DEGs, at least 24 genes that were upregulated in crw1 have been previously reported to be involved in the resistance to drought, salinity, cold, or diseases (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">31</ref>). Evolution of land plants is accompanied with expansion of genes involved in hormone signaling and transcription factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> . Our study shows that mechanosensing induced Ca 2+ signaling plays an unexpected role in balancing the ethylene-auxin signaling pathways for gravitropic growth of plants in soil.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics and reproducibility</head><p>The experiments performed in this study were repeated independently at least three times with similar results. The data are presented as the mean ± SD and the microscope images presented are the most representative of the results. The significance of the difference between two sets of data was tested by one-or two-sided Student's t-test using Microsoft Excel 2019. The difference among more than two sets of data was analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's test as post hoc analysis using IBM SPSS Statistics 21.0. No statistical method was used to predetermine sample size. No data were excluded from the analyses. The experiments were not randomized. The Investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1 | crw1 shows defective gravitropism when grown in water but not in soil. a-d Seedlings of WT and crw1 were grown in water or soil for 2 days. a Root phenotypes. b Root caps. c Lugol's staining of amyloplast. d, e Responses of WT and crw1 roots to gravity stimulation.
