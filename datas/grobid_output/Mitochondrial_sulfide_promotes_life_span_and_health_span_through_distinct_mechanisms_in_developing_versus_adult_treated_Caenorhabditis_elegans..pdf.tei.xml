<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Deteriorating health across the life course is a major societal burden, and effective therapeutics are lacking. Mitochondrial decline has long been associated with age-related health loss. We show that small, clinically meaningful doses of a mitochondriontargeting sulfur donor (AP39) extend Caenorhabditis elegans health in older age, which act by maintaining mitochondrial integrity. Adult onset of AP39 delivery, when mitochondrial and cell structural dysfunction are already manifested, also promoted healthy aging. Distinct association of health span extension with mitochondria, cytoskeletal and peroxisome molecular profiles, under regulation of the elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor regulatory circuit, further distinguished adult-onset AP39 therapy. Our results establish a framework for forward translating mitochondrial sulfide as a potentially viable healthy aging intervention in mammals.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>pnas.org <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>, and developmentally established mitochondrial dynamics determine rates of adult respiration and aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Additionally, life-extending mitochondrial interventions in C. elegans currently require administration on or before the developmental larval stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Metabolic patterns set during developmental H 2 S treatments might, therefore, mediate life span and health span extension. The efficacy of H 2 S administered during "normal" stochastic aging thus warrants investigation to understand the viability of adult H 2 S-based therapies.</p><p>Several cellular processes are responsive to H 2 S that can regulate H 2 S-mediated longevity <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref>, yet the mechanisms governing H 2 S-mediated health span are undefined. Increasing evidence supports a mitochondrion-centric mode of H 2 S action across cell types and pathologies. Current dogma suggests H 2 S donates electrons to the mitochondrial electron transport chain, inhibits mitochondrial cAMP phosphodiesterases, facilitates mitochondrial DNA repair, promotes mitochondrial antioxidant protection, and augments mitochondrial respiration/ATP production (reviewed in ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24)</ref>. Moreover, mitochondrial loss is one of the nine hallmarks of aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref> and is the earliest detectable subcellular structural change during C. elegans aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, preceding physiological decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. As such, therapies that exploit positive H 2 S effects on mitochondria represent an attractive antiaging strategy. The mitochondrial sulfide delivery molecule (mtH 2 S), AP39, exploits mitochondrial membrane potential by utilizing a TPP + motif to localize H 2 S to the mitochondria and protect against cellular injury [e.g., glucose oxidase-induced mitochondrial dysfunction <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>] vs. equal doses of untargeted H 2 S donors. Consequently, unlike untargeted H 2 S compounds (e.g., GYY4137, FW1256) with supraphysiological effective doses <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, mtH 2 S displays potency at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower in C. elegans disease models <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14)</ref>. Whether such phenomena occur in the aging context is unknown; however, mtH 2 S is plausibly responsible for longevity and health span extension reported following larger untargeted H 2 S doses.</p><p>This study, therefore, investigated the efficacy of a mtH 2 S (AP39) for promoting health span via mitochondrion-mediated effects vs. untargeted H 2 S donors, using C. elegans as an aging model. Given the unknown capacity of H 2 S as an efficacious therapy in aging adults, we also examined health span effects of adult-onset H 2 S treatments. Using functional pharmacogenetic approaches, we provide evidence that mtH 2 S is a requirement for, and site of action of, H 2 S-mediated health span promotion. Importantly, mtH 2 S increases health span when administered to young and middle-aged adults, and this adult treatment effect is clearly reflected at the transcriptomic level compared to developmental mtH 2 S administration, under the control of a GATA family of transcription factors. These findings strongly suggest that augmentation of mitochondrial sulfide may represent a druggable target and translatable therapeutic approach to maintaining health with advancing age, at time points where the negative effects of aging already manifest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>mtH 2 S Increases C. elegans Life span and Neuromuscular Health span. We first investigated the effects of mitochondrion-targeted and nontargeted H 2 S donors on C. elegans life span. Dosing L1 larvae with the untargeted sulfide donor NaGYY4137 (100 µM) increased maximal life span by 20 % (P &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>), which is comparable to previous studies using GYY4137 (morpholine salt) and related compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. In sharp contrast, the mitochondrion-targeted sulfide delivery molecule (mtH 2 S) AP39 significantly increased life span at 1000-fold lower doses (100 nM) by 30% (P &lt; 0.0001) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>), whereas equivalent 100 nM doses of untargeted NaGYY4137 had no significant effect on C. elegans life span extension (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>).</p><p>We next assessed movement rates on days 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 of life span as a robust proxy of overall animal health <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref> and, therefore, health span. Using wMicroTracker to measure prolonged movement capacity beyond standard thrash assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>, wild-type movement capacity peaked at day 4 of adulthood (+97% vs. day 0 baseline), as previously published <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>, and progressively declined thereafter to a nadir of -26% at day 16 (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). At greatly different doses, 100 µM NaGYY4137 H 2 S and 100 nM mtH 2 S increased total animal movement rates across the life course (P &lt; 0.001), using area under the curve analysis of movement across the life course, as previously published <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref> (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>). Post hoc analysis showed significant health span extension in mtH 2 S (100 nM)-treated animals up to day 16 postadulthood compared to day 12 postadulthood during NaGYY4137 treatments (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>). Loss of neuromuscular strength is also one of the strongest correlates of all-cause mortality in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35)</ref>, leading us to employ our "NemaFlex" device <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(38)</ref> to examine neuromuscular strength changes across age. As with movement rates (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S1</ref>), wild-type strength capacity increased between days 0 and 4 adulthood and declined thereafter. Conversely, treatment with mtH 2 S (100 nM) improved strength production across days 0-10 postadulthood (P &lt; 0.001), with a significant 20% strength increase vs. wild-type at day 10 (Fig. <ref type="figure">2B</ref>). Additionally, while the observed effect sizes of mtH are comparable to those reported for other life span-extending compounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>, the improvements we observed are modest. We, therefore, directly compared mtH 2 S to a recently published life span and health span improving drug, rilmenidine (42), using our microfluidic "Nemalife" health span device, and found both compounds extended life span and health span to similar degrees using our microfluidic approach (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S2</ref>). Rilmendine also has no effect on neuromuscular health parameters in early life <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref> but rather manifest in older age time points, as observed herein for mtH 2 S. Collectively, these data strongly suggest that H 2 S effects on health span are likely mediated through mitochondrial effects which, although modest, may be highly beneficial, since aging is also associated with a later life loss of prolonged movement and strength-producing capacity.</p><p>mtH 2 S Maintains Mitochondrial Structure and Content. Given the well-established role of mitochondrial dysfunction in age-related health decline across species (25), we examined whether mtH 2 S health span promotion associated with maintained mitochondrial integrity. Using green fluorescent protein-tagged mitochondrion transgenic animals to compare lower dose mtH 2 S (100 nM) to higher dose untargeted H 2 S (100 µM), mitochondrial structure was scored as either well networked, or moderately fragmented. Well-networked mitochondria at day 0 of adulthood presented in 88% of wild-type animals, which was not affected by either mtH 2 S or untargeted H 2 S treatments. In line with previous reports (26), by day 2 postadulthood well-networked mitochondria reduced to 21% in wild-type worms. The number of well-networked mitochondria increased threefold with mtH 2 S treatment at day 2 of adulthood, and twofold with untargeted H 2 S (P &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Only mtH 2 S significantly sustained mitochondrial integrity at day 4 postadulthood (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). In wild-type animals, the number of moderately fragmented mitochondria increased progressively from day 2 of adulthood (21% of animals), reaching 86% by day 16. Comparable delays in moderate mitochondrial fragmentation were observed between mtH 2 S and untargeted H 2 S from days 8 to 12 postadulthood, whereas only mtH 2 S supressed moderate fragmentation up to day 14 of adulthood (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). We also assessed citrate synthase activity (CS) as a marker of mitochondrial health, which correlates with mitochondrial content, biosynthesis, and cristae area <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. Untargeted H 2 S failed to induce a significant effect on CS across the life course. Conversely, mtH 2 S significantly increased CS throughout life span, and to a greater extent than untargeted H 2 S (up to day 12, P &lt; 0.0001), with significant increases in CS presenting up to day 4, but not day 12 of life span (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3E</ref>). To confirm that differences in H 2 S bioavailability does not underpin the improved efficacy of mtH 2 S vs. untargeted H 2 S for maintaining mitochondrial structure and content, we assessed total animal sulfide levels and found no difference with either compound at day 4 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S3</ref>).</p><p>Thus, mtH 2 S improves mitochondrial integrity across age, which associates with health span maintenance. AP39-Mediated Health span Extension Requires H 2 S Metabolism and FoxO Pathways, but Not Nrf2 Oxidative Stress Protection.</p><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate longevity in response to exogenous H 2 S ( <ref type="formula">19</ref>), yet the mechanisms governing health span extension are unknown. To probe this, we performed a hypothesis-driven RNAi gene knockdown and a mtH 2 S pharmacogenetic screen, using a microfluidic life span machine to assess animal health every day of the life course. First, we examined the requirement for enzymes controlling endogenous H 2 S synthesis: cytosolic cystathionine-βsynthase (CBS/cbs-1) and cystathionine-γlyase (CSE/cth-2), and cytoplasmic/mitochondrial 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST/mpst-1) (8-10).</p><p>Corroborating previous reports, we found that cth-2 knockdown alone had no effect on life span <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref> and knocking down cbs-1 or mpst-1 shortened life span <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44)</ref> (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). Knockdown of cth-2 also did not significantly affect health span, whereas knockdown of cbs-1 and mpst-1 RNAi both impaired health span (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). Cotreatment of RNAi against cth-2, cbs-1 or mpst-1 with mtH 2 S from L1 stage prevented the positive effects of mtH 2 S on life span and health span (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). While exogenous mtH 2 S might be anticipated to bypass endogenous H 2 S biosynthesis pathways, analysis of total animal sulfide levels confirmed a need for functional H 2 S producing enzymes, since mtH 2 S-induced sulfide increases in older age were ablated when combined with cth-2, mpst-1 or cbs-1 RNAi (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">S5</ref>). Combined with the loss of mtH 2 S-induced life span and health span extension with knockdown of the H 2 S synthesizing enzymes kri-1 and cysl-2 (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>), the H 2 S synthesis system is a general requirement for the positive effects of mtH 2 S donors on C. elegans health and longevity. We next examined the potential involvement of enzymes involved in wider H 2 S metabolism: ETHE1/ethe-1, a mitochondrial sulfur dioxygenase necessary for H 2 S catabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>, and GSR/gsr-1, a glutathione reductase involved in H 2 S-mediated production of glutathione <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>. Knockdown of ethe-1 alone did not affect life span but significantly increased health span and, when combined with mtH 2 S, prevented mtH 2 S-induced life span 2. Mitochondrion-targeted H 2 S extends movement rate and maximal strength indices of health span. (A) Animal movement rate is increased across the entire lifecourse with both lower dose (100 nM) mitochondrion-targeted H 2 S (AP39) and higher dose (100 µM) untargeted H 2 S (NaGYY4137) when administered from L1 larval stage until death. Movement rates as a % change from day 0 baselines, across days 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 postadulthood, are presented as area under the curve. (B) Lower dose (100 nM) mitochondriontargeted H 2 S maintains C. elegans maximal strength producing ability in later life (day 10 postadulthood), measured using our microfluidic NemaFlex device. Data presented are mean ± SD, n = 90 per condition, across 3 biological replicates. *P &lt; 0.05, **P &lt; 0.01 and ****P &lt; 0.0001 denotes significant difference vs. untreated (0.01% DMSO) wild-type controls. and health span extension. Because ethe-1 catabolizes H 2 S, we postulated that harmful H 2 S accumulation might occur following combined exogenous mtH 2 S administration. Examining the dose response (1nM to 2 µM) of mtH 2 S + ethe-1 knockdown revealed no further decline in animal health span, however life span became shortened at higher (100 nM to 2 µM) doses (SI Appendix, Fig. S6). Both life span and health span were reduced following gsr-1 knockdown, which also inhibited life/health span extension with concurrent mtH 2 S treatment. Additionally, the FoxO/daf-16 transcription factor has been implicated in H 2 S life span extension (19), and we observed lowered life span and health span with daf-16 knockdown alone, corroborating previous reports (47). mtH 2 S did not increase life span or health span in animals subjected to daf-16 RNAi (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). H 2 S also regulated cellular redox homeostasis, in part through activation of the Nrf2 transcription factor and associated signaling pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. We, therefore, knocked down Nrf2/skn-1 or DCAF11/wdr-23 as a negative upstream regulator of Nrf2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(49)</ref>. In line with previous reports (50) skn-1 knockdown animals were short lived, whereas wdr-23 deficient worms were longer lived. Both skn-1 and wdr-23 RNAi also resulted in extended health span. Agreeing with earlier studies showing a need for the Nrf2 system for H 2 S-induced C. elegans life span extension (44), we also observed prevention of mtH 2 S increases in life span with combined skn-1 or wdr-23 knockdown. Despite this, our findings reveal that the Nrf2 system is not required for mtH 2 S-associated health span extension. We observed this same phenomenon with other components of the Nrf2 pathway, including the Nrf2-controlled glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit, GCLC/gcs-1. Only the Nrf2 nuclear translocation regulatory factor RelA/ikke-1 attenuated mtH 2 S health span improvements (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>). Our data strongly suggest that the positive health span effects of mtH 2 S were not dependent on the Nrf2 signaling system.</p><p>Last, we investigated the role of two H 2 S-responsive candidates, the mitochondrion-located heat shock protein chaperone HSPA9/hsp-6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, and the hypoxia inducible transcription factor HIF1A/ hif-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. Knockdown of both hsp-6 or hif-1 significantly increased life span and health span, and combined gene knockdown with mtH 2 S did not impact the life span and health span promoting effects of mtH 2 S (Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>).</p><p>Adult Treatments with mtH 2 S Extend Health span, but Not Life span. Life span and health span extension have only been previously reported with untargeted H 2 S continuously administered from L1 larval stage until death. We, therefore, treated animals with low (100 nM) dose AP39 or 1000-fold higher (100 µM) dose NaGYY4137, starting in either day 0 young adults, day 2 of adulthood (chosen as the time point of mitochondrial fragmentation onset, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref> and ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26)</ref>, or day 4 of adulthood [chosen as the time point when tissue structural integrity begins to decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>]. Both mtH 2 S and untargeted H 2 S donors were ineffective at increasing animal life span when administered from day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P &gt; 0.05). Conversely, health span was significantly increased by mtH 2 S when administered from either day 0, 2, or 4 of adulthood (P &lt; 0.01) and was also increased with untargeted H 2 S treatments starting from days 2 or 4 postadulthood (P &lt; 0.05), but not in day 0 young adults (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> and SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S7</ref>). Additionally, mtH 2 S administered from day 0 adulthood significantly increased the number of normally arrayed mitochondria at days 4 and 10 postadulthood, and improved sarcomere organization at day 10 postadulthood (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S8</ref>). Providing further evidence that improved mitochondrial health underpins mtH 2 S health improvements, we also found significantly lower mitochondrial superoxide levels during aging with adult mtH 2 S treatment (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure">S9</ref>).</p><p>Health span was thus extended when mtH 2 S was delivered to adult animals, at time points where key aging subcellular defects occur, and is reflected in delayed onset of age-related dystrophic muscle and dysfunctional mitochondria.</p><p>Adult mtH 2 S Treatments Maintain Mitochondrion-and Peroxisome-Enriched Transcriptomes in Later Life. To better understand the molecules governing life span and health span responsiveness to mtH 2 S, we performed next-generation sequencing on animals treated with mtH 2 S from L1 larvae or from day 0 of adulthood. Principal component analysis revealed distinct features of C. elegans transcriptomes across days 0, 4, and 10 postadulthood. Moreover, mtH 2 S-treated animals displayed similar gene features to wild-type at day 0 and 4 of adulthood. Divergence from wild-type presented in older day 10 animals, with a shift toward day 4 features in mtH 2 S treatments, particularly when treated from day 0 young adulthood (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). Consistent with principal component analysis, global transcriptomic dysregulation at day 10 postadulthood was reduced in animals treated with mtH 2 S at adult onset only (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>). Next, clustering of differentially expressed genes using expression profiles (51-53) identified four most prominent differentially expressed gene clusters (i.e., clusters containing &gt;200 differentially expressed genes). Two of these (Clusters 8 and 14) exhibited an elevated expression profile in later life (day 10 postadulthood) that was suppressed with adult onset mtH 2 S but unaffected by mtH 2 S administered from birth (L1 stage), and were functionally associated with FoxO, proteolytic, mitophagy, and ribosome translational processes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5 C</ref> and <ref type="figure">D</ref>).</p><p>Analyzing the top 10 ranked protein-protein interaction (PPI) network hub nodes for each cluster identified daf-2-responsive Fbox genes (fbxb-</p><p>41, fbxb-54, fbxb-91, M116.1, pes-2.2, T05D4.2, T25E12.6) and autophagy (C35E7.5) components as prominent cluster 8 hubs. Cluster 14 hubs aligned almost exclusively to nucleolus localized components (lpd-7, nol-6, nol-14, pro-3, rpl-24.2) involved in RNA-binding activity as part of the ribonucleoprotein complex (F49D11.10, rbm-28, toe-1, W09C5.1, Y45F10D.7). As with wider cluster expression profiles, gene expression of hub components was predominantly altered at day 10 older age and in response to adult mtH 2 S treatments only (Fig. 5E). Table 1.

All raw data are provided in SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S4</ref>.</p><p>Moreover, two gene clusters (Clusters 3 and 13) that aligned to cytoskeletal structure, mitochondria, and general metabolism functional classes, displayed progressive expression declines with age. In both clusters, mtH 2 S administered from L1 again failed to affect the age-related loss of gene expression. Conversely, adult-onset mtH 2 S treatment induced a strong maintenance of gene expression, emerging specifically in day 10 adults (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5 C</ref> and <ref type="figure">D</ref>). Additionally, this pattern of age-related gene expression changes remaining unaltered by L1 mtH 2 S administration, but rejuvenated by adult-onset mtH 2 S in later life emerged across nearly all other 27 gene clusters identified (SI Appendix, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S10</ref>). Top ranked hubs for cluster 3 related mostly to muscle cytoskeletal proteins (C46G7.2, cpn-3, mlc-1, mup-2, tnt-2, unc-27), but included regulators of calcium homeostasis (csq-1) and glutathione transferase activity (gst-26). Within cluster 13, there was striking enrichment for hubs functionally associated with peroxisomal components (acox-1.1, acox-1.2, B0272.4, ctl-2, daf-22, dhs-28) and lysosomal cathepsin proteases (asp-1, asp-3). Again, only adult-onset mtH 2 S treatments appeared to attenuate the age-related reduction in gene expression of hub components, in older day 10 animals (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>). To probe the mechanistic influence of these hub genes in the positive aging effects of adult-onset mtH 2 S, we examined the requirement of the peroxisomal catalase ctl-2 as the most strongly maintained hub gene across clusters 3, 8, 13, and 14 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>). RNAi knockdown of ctl-2 exacerbated early adult mitochondrial fragmentation and prevented the mtH 2 S-induced mitochondrial maintainance in early and later life (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S11</ref>), therein supporting the functional and mechanistic relevance of our identified transcriptomic targets.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A GATA Transcription Factor Regulatory Circuit Underpins the</head><p>Positive Aging Effects of mtH 2 S. We next sought to examine the mechanistic role of genes responsive to mtH 2 S during aging; however, the clusters identified represent several dozen individual differentially expressed genes. We, therefore, employed transcription factor (TF)binding site analysis to identify TFs predicted to commonly regulate the cytoskeletal (Cluster 3) and peroxisomal (Cluster 13) gene clusters that display mtH 2 S-induced preservation in older age. From this, a single transcription factor, elt-3 (part of a GATA family of transcription factors), emerged as the putative regulator of both gene clusters (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>). During wild-type aging, expression of elt-5 and elt-6 increase which, in turn, repress expression of elt-3 to regulate a large portion of age-related transcriptome changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>. Our untreated controls mirrored this response at the transcriptional level, and these expression changes are reversed by adult onset mtH 2 S (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">S12</ref>). Next, using transgenic animals coexpressing ELT-6 RFP and mitochondrial GFP reporters, we confirmed protein level ELT-6 upregulation during aging, which was suppressed by adult onset mtH 2 S treatment (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> A and B), and corresponded with improved mitochondrial structure and movement rates (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> C and D).</p><p>Additionally, knockdown of either elt-6 or elt-3, while not affecting animal movement rate in middle age and older age, prevented mtH 2 Sinduced movement increases (Fig. <ref type="figure">6 E</ref> and <ref type="figure">F</ref>).</p><p>To verify the role of elt-6/elt-3, we examined the cytoskeleton (adherens junction) and mitochondrion-localized protein BAR-1/ βcatenin, loss of which is reported to upr-egulate gene clusters under regulation by elt-3 (55) which would, therefore, be anticipated to also down-regulate ELT-6. Consistent with this model, we observed that bar-1 RNAi prevented age-related increases in ELT-6 expression (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13</ref>). Moreover, mtH 2 S did not synergistically lower age-related ELT-6 levels when combined with bar-1 RNAi (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">S13</ref>), implying some functional association with mtH 2 S and bar-1/β-catenin (further supporting a role for mtH 2 S in modifiying the cytoskeleton via the elt-6/elt-3 circuit). While the precise causal mechanisms linking H 2 S-related mitochondrial improvements with the elt-6/elt-3 system and, subsequently, health span remains undefined, the mitochondrial mechanisms appear specific to the aging context; although we show aging mitochondrial decline and mtH 2 S acts through this TF circtuit, inducing acute severe mitochondrial decline via toxic drugs fails to activate ELT-6 despite major structural fragmentation of mitochondria (SI Appendix, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S14</ref>). Combined, our systems biological studies provide evidence that mtH 2 S improves mitochondrial health to alter elt-3 TFs, which likely act as a reguatory circuit governing cytoskeletal and peroxisomal gene clusters to, ultimately, modify health span.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>H 2 S is a diatomic signaling molecule that promotes healthy aging in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>, yet the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic viability across the lifecourse remains unclear. In this study, we have demonstrated that low mtH 2 S doses extend C. elegans health span, which associates with improved mitochondrial integrity from young adulthood into older age. Multiple elements of H 2 S metabolic pathways, and FoxO transciption factors emerged as mechanisms governing both life span and health span, whereas the Nrf2 antioxidant system is dispensible for mtH 2 S-induced health span extension. Adult mtH 2 S treatments also increase health span, predominantly in later life, and associates with rejuvenation of key features of the aging transciptome, including mitochondrial function, cytoskeletal content, and peroxisomal metabolism, which appear to be controlled by a GATA transcription factor circuit.</p><p>The ability of large amounts of untargeted H 2 S, administered from birth, to enhance C. elegans life span and health span, is well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>. Our data reveal 1000-fold lower doses of a mitochondrion-targeted (TPP + -driven) H 2 S donor (28) can account for the life span, health span, and neuromuscular strength extension elicited by H 2 S. Thus, small amounts of H 2 S transported to the mitochondria are likely responsible for, and the site of action of, H 2 S effects on longevity. Temporal analysis further revealed mtH 2 S improved mitochondrion integrity beginning in earlier life that was maintained throughout the lifecourse, thus delaying one of the primary cellular hallmarks of aging <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>. Conversely, mtH 2 S did not increase movement rates or muscle strength until older age, likely owing to a lack of declines in muscle strength and habitual movement capacity during early adulthood, which is unsurprising, if decreasing H 2 S metabolism/synthesis is an aging pathology <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>. These findings closely mirror the human phenotype, where a clear biphasic pattern of muscle aging emerges that involves early disruption to metabolic processes (57, 58) (as with C. elegans early loss of mitochondria integrity), which later manifests as exponential neuromuscular strength/ physical capacity declines (again, as occurs in C. elegans) that exceeds rates of musle mass losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60)</ref>. As such, our data evidence that mtH 2 S can target the early mitochondrial metabolic perturbations during aging, possibly in preference over targeting respiratory function of existing mitochondria <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62)</ref> that attenuates the ensuing later changes in neuromuscular performance and health <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62)</ref>.</p><p>While the mechanisms regulating H 2 S-induced longevity have been explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>, understanding the molecules governing health span is at least equally valuable, given the growing societal burden of life span -health span dissociation. Of the fourteen genes targeted for established roles in H 2 S biology, two clear functional themes emerged as mechanisms of mtH 2 S life span and health span extension. First, the FoxO/daf-16 transcription factor is a highly conserved regulator of longevity across species <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(63)</ref> and in response to untargeted H 2 S <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Our findings extend this to show daf-16 is also required for mtH 2 S-related health span improvements. Second, although exogenous H 2 S could hypothetically bypass the biochemical need for endogenous H 2 S synthesis, the H 2 S metabolism genes examined (most strikingly the mitochondria localized 3-MST/mpst-1) were required for health span extension by mtH 2 S. Moreover, mtH 2 S-induced sulfide increases were prevented by cth-2, mpst-1, or cbs-1 knockdown. Thus, while perhaps counterintuitive, presence of a functional H 2 S production system is a requirement for efficacious mtH 2 S treatments and might reflect the multifaceted cellular roles of the H 2 S enzymatic machinery and/or the diverse downstream consequences of loss of these enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(64)</ref>. For example, H 2 S likely exerts at least part of its biological effects via cysteine persulfidation of multiple protein targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>. The mitochondrially localized 3-MST/mpst-1 is also a trans-persulfidase <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(66)</ref>, thus H 2 S enzyme knockdown could prevent mtH 2 S-mediated persulfidation events, through which H 2 S might partially act. Interestingly, despite fatal consqeuences of complete ETHE1 knockout in higher mammals <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>, RNAi knockdown of the mitochondrial H 2 S catabolic enzyme ETHE1/ethe-1 strongly improved health span, possibly by mimicking mtH 2 S through mitochondrial accumulation of noncatabolized endogenous H 2 S. However, combined ethe-1 RNAi and mtH 2 S ablates health span extension, and life span becomes shortened at higher, but not lower (1 to 10 nM) mtH 2 S doses, potentially due to toxic mtH 2 S accumulation, implying tight physio logical range of mtH 2 S hormesis. Overall, these mechanistic insights add further evidence that place mitochondria at the center of H 2 S-regulated health span.</p><p>Activation of the Nrf2/skn-1 antioxidant system has also been reported to control H 2 S-based longevity in C. elegans <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(48)</ref>. Oxidative stress and reactive oxidant species might be a secondary consequence of tissue aging that may exacerbate, rather than cause aging health decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(67)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(68)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(69)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(70)</ref>. While corroborating the requirement of the Nrf2 pathway for H 2 S life span extension, multiple components of the Nrf2/skn-1 system, including the upstream activator DACF11/wdr-23 and downstream effector GCLC/gcs-1, were not required for mtH 2 S health span improvements. Knocking down KRIT1/kri-1, which activates Nrf2 through redox species generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>, did prevent mtH 2 S-induced health span extension. However, since several Nrf2 system components are not mechanisms of mtH 2 S health span extension, KRIT1/kri-1 health span regulation likely relies on its alternate functions in H 2 S synthesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. Importantly, these results highlight clear dissociation between the fundamental mechanisms governing life span vs. health span, indicating that oxidative stress protection pathways are dispensable for mtH 2 S-extended health span, but not life span.</p><p>The potential for developmentally programmed metabolic patterns with larval H 2 S treatments <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref> renders the efficacy of postadulthood H 2 S therapies uncertain. We establish health span alone is extended with young adult mtH 2 S treatments, and when initiated in the presence of existing aging tissue pathologies. We, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, found that mitochondrial fragmentation begins early in life (2 days postadulthood), and in this study we report that mtH 2 S improves health span when administered at this time. Similarly, muscle structural and proteostasis abnormalities occur later (4 days postadulthood), and mtH 2 S also displays efficacy during this therapeutic window. Mitochondrial H 2 S is, therefore, a viable adult-onset antiaging therapeutic opportunity. Transcriptomic studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms regulating adult mtH 2 S health span extension revealed clear distinctions from larval treatments. Whilet administering mtH 2 S from L1 stage caused broad transcriptional features that diverged only slightly from wild-type animals only in older age, adult-onset mtH 2 S caused strong rejuvenation of the aging transcriptome toward "younger" gene profiles. Cluster analysis revealed adult mtH 2 S suppressed aging-induced increases in FoxO/daf-16 pathway expression. Whilet contrasting our observation that daf-16 is a required effector of larval mtH 2 S treatment, suppression of aging daf-16 levels with adult mtH 2 S implies divergent effects of FoxO induction during development vs. postdevelopment <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>. This is consistent with earlier reports that longevity caused by up-regulating FoxO/daf-16 (via insulin receptor/daf-2 mutation) is primarily established during larval development <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(72)</ref>. Conversely, sarcopenia associates with postdevelopmental FoxO upregulation across species (58), corresponding with later life metabolic reprogramming to compensate for aging health decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(57,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58)</ref>. Consistent with a potential beneficial aging effect of reduced postadulthood FoxO expression, are the moderate health span improvements we report with mtH 2 S-related daf-16 suppression. This phenomenon underscores an unexplained paradox in aging research, whereby developmentally programmed life span extension (e.g., with increased FoxO signaling) presents at the expense of health span <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. Indeed, in people, FoxO genetic variants correlate with centenarians ( <ref type="formula">73</ref>), yet impaired insulin signaling/ increased FoxO induced during adulthood causes serious clinical complications (e.g., diabetes, sarcopenia). Our data support a model whereby postdevelopmental, aging-induced increases in FoxO expression are harmful to health span <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(71)</ref>, and drug interventions such as mtH 2 S that lower this response improve health whilet having minimal effect on longevity. Last, adult mtH 2 S also caused suppression of age-related increases in mitophagy and, most prominently, ribosomal biogenesis. Thus, mtH 2 S might mitigate unchecked mitophagy by preventing the mitochondrial dysfunction that promotes mitophagy with age (74), and promote improved translational efficiency as previously proposed to underpin physical activity-based anti-aging regimens <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">76)</ref>.</p><p>Adult mtH 2 S treatment also better maintained later-life expression of lowered aging transcriptomic profiles. Genes clustering to mitochondrion function featured heavily, lending further support to the central role of mitochondria in mtH 2 S-mediated health span. pnas.org</p><p>Expression of muscle cytoskeletal components also decreased with age, which was minimized by adult mtH 2 S administration, with top ranked hub components largely represented by cytoskeletal (e.g., troponin regulation) factors. Given the later life temporal correlation between increased muscle structural genes and movement/strength capacity, mtH 2 S represents a promising neuromuscular health intervention in older age. Last, loss of metabolic plasticity is a common feature of aging across species (25). We found progressive reduction in expression of metabolic functional clusters across aging that was increased with adult onset mtH 2 S. Notably, metabolic cluster hub genes were strongly enriched for peroxisomal components. Peroxisomes are essential for proper functioning of all cell types, compartmentalizing enzymes regulating, e.g., fatty acid βoxidation and hydrogen peroxide metabolism. Several facets of peroxisome dysfunction cause accelerated aging (77), and our data suggest peroxisome function can be sustained by mtH 2 S across life span. For example, dhs-28 regulates age-dependent peroxisome loss, knockdown of which extends C. elegans life span (78), and our findings identify dhs-28 as a top ranked, mtH 2 Sresponsive hub component. Moreover, we confirm the mechanistic relevance of our identified peroxisomal transcriptomic targets by showing knockdown of the ctl-2 hub gene prevents mtH 2 S-induced health span extension. Growing evidence also highlights inextricable cross talk between peroxisome and mitochondrial function (79). Indeed, caloric restriction-induced longevity [whose mechanisms converge with those of H 2 S (80)], requires mitochondria structural maintenance which, in turn, promotes peroxisome fatty acid oxidation (81). Our early-life improvements in mitochondrial integrity, combined with mitochondria localizing H 2 S, demonstrate improvements in mitochondrial integrity precede, and perhaps regulate, later life improvements in peroxisome capacity. Additionally, the lack of mechanistic regulation of health span by the Nrf2 antioxidant system implies that improved peroxisome fatty acid oxidation, as opposed to lowered reactive oxygen species generation, underpin peroxisomal effects of mtH 2 S on healthy aging.</p><p>Transcription factor-binding site analysis of our transcriptomic data identified the GATA TF circuit elt-6/elt-3 as putatively regulating the health span benefits of adult onset mtH 2 S, which were subsequently verified by our mechanistic experiments. Previous work established age-related elt-6 upregulation and downstream repression of elt-3, which accounted for altered expression of ~1,300 "aging" genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(54)</ref>, which might comprise an evolutionarily conserved element of natural aging adaptation that promotes longevity, perhaps at the expense of health span, similarly to FoxO. Here, we confirm the relevance of this aging TF axis and establish elt-6/elt-3 as mechanisms through which mtH 2 S and, either interrelatedly or independently via bar-1/ βcatenin, act to affect aging health. Interestingly, mitochondrial dysfunction per se is insufficient to explain elt-6 upregulation, since severe toxin-induced mitochondrial insults fail to induce ELT-6. Thus, some as yet unknown specificity to age-related mitochondrial decline alters the elt-6 pathway to induce gene expression changes that impair health span. Regardless, our combined functional, morphologic, transcriptomic, and mechanistic results point to a model where aging mitcohondrial decline activates GATA TFs to alter gene expression, centered on cytoskeletal and peroxisomal gene clusters, to impair animal health. Crucially, mtH 2 S is an efficacious therapeutic approach for targeting the mitochondria to reverse this aging signaling axis and, ultimately, improve health span.</p><p>In conclusion, a systems biological approach identifies the mitochondria as the primary site of H 2 S action for slowing aging, with distinct molecular mechanisms underpinning life span vs. health span extension. Unlike life span, increased mtH 2 S health span does not require activation of the Nrf2 antioxidant system. Adult-onset mtH 2 S also increases health span alone, which associates with unique aging transcriptomic signatures compared to life span-extending developmental mtH 2 S treatments, under the control of elt-6/elt-3 GATA transcription factors. The emergence of neuromuscular health improvements in later life might also be underpinned by temporally correlated, mtH 2 S-responsive transcriptomic features of mitochondria, peroxisomal metabolism, and cytoskeletal function. Finally, the comparably lower mtH 2 S donor doses (vs. nontargeted NaGYY4137; &gt;3 orders of magnitude difference) required for aging health benefits, combined with efficacy in adult animals and high conservation of associated mechanisms, renders mtH 2 S a possible translational antiaging therapy.</p></div>

After RNA sequencing data preprocessing (see SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section), the DESeq2 package for R (88) was used to test for differential gene expression. Establishing approaches to adaptive shrinkage methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">(89)</ref> and control for false discovery rate (FDR) were employed. DEGreport R was applied to normalized counts to group by expression profile any gene differentially regulated between treatments and/or time points. Functional enrichment analysis of defined gene clusters was then undertaken using the gprofiler2 package for R <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">(90)</ref>. Each gene cluster was also input into the Online Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING, v11.5; ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">91)</ref> to infer respective PPI networks. Full details of the bioinformatic pipeline employed are provided in Supplemental methods section.</p><p>7-azido-4-Methylcoumarin Measures of Total Sulfide Levels. In all, 120 animals were picked into M9 buffer in 1.5 mL low-bind eppendorphs and washed three times with 1 mL sterile M9 to clear bacterial debris and progeny. Samples were snap-frozen in 40 µL M9 and stored at -80 °C until analysis (within 1 wk). Sulfide content was assessed as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">86)</ref> as described in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods section.</p><p>ELT-6 Fluorescent Reporter Quantification. The SD1550 strain harboring an elt-6 fluorescent promoter and mitochondrial GFP (ccIs4251 [(pSAK2) myo-3p::GFP::LacZ::NLS + (pSAK4) myo-3p::mitochondrial GFP + dpy-20(+)] I. stIs10178 [elt-6p::HIS-24::mCherry + unc-119(+)] was imaged on an upright epifluorescent microscope (BX43, Olympus Life Science, UK). All elt-6 images were taken with mCherry fluorescence at 500-ms exposure and GFP fluorescence set to 50-ms exposure for mitochondrial images. Single images were taken from the head for ELT-6, as the sole site of ELT-6 reporter expression pattern, and from head and tail regions for mitochondrial characterisation across 40-60 animals per condition, per time point. Mitochondrial images were analyzed as detailed above, and ELT-6 images were quantified in ImageJ by performing integrated density quantification on each fluorescent image, subtracting background fluorescence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mitochondrial Toxic Stress Assays in ELT-6 Transgenic Reporter Animals.</head><p>Age-synchronized SD1550 animals were grown to young adulthood on 33-mm NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria. Approximately 30 day 0 adults where then picked into 40 μL of either 100 μM hydrogen peroxide (Sigma, UK; 7722-84-1) or 5 mM sodium arsenite (Santa Cruz, DE; 7784-46-5) diluted in M9 for 1-and 2-h exposures, respectively. For rotenone and antimycin A exposures, animals were picked into 40 μL 50 μM or 100 μM concentrations, respectively, diluted in 20 mg/mL OP50/ NGM bacteria and incubated for 4 h. Tubes where then washed three times with M9 before animals were pipetted onto slides and immobilized by a coverslip. Both ELT-6 and mitochondrial images were then captured and analyzed as detailed above.</p><p>Mitochondrial Superoxide Assessment. Superoxide levels were measured using MitoSOX (Invitrogen, UK) as described previously <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(86,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">92)</ref>. For day 0 measures, animals were grown on OP50 plates until L3 larval stage, where ~30 animals were then picked onto petri plates + OP50 seeded with a final plate concentration of 10 μM MitoSOX and left to incubate in the dark for 24 h. The same exposures were performed for day 4 and day 10 measures (i.e., day 3 and day 9 adults picked onto MitoSOX plates for 24 h, respectively). On the day of imaging, animals were washed from plates with M9 buffer into 1.5 mL low-bind tubes and washed three times to clear the outer cuticle of probe. Animals were then placed on OP50 plates for 1-h to clear residual probe from the gut. Animals were then picked into 20 μL M9 buffer on glass slides with glass coverslip. Images were taken with a 40× objective with green light excitation and a 1-s exposure rate. The terminal bulb was manually selected in ImageJ and integrated fluorescence density was normalized to the total area of analysis and background fluorescence removed.</p><p>Statistics and Data Analysis. Statistics and graph generation were performed in GraphPad Prism 9. Significance was determined by paired t test or 2-way ANOVA, with post hoc multiple comparison tests. For survival analyses, the Log-Rank (Mantel Cox) test was used.</p><p>Data, Materials, and Software Availability. All study data are included in the article and/or supporting information.
