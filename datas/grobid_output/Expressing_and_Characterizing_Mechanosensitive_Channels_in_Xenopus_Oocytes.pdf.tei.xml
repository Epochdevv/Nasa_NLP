<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The oocytes of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) comprise one of the most widely used membrane protein expression systems. While frequently used for studies of transporters and ion channels, the application of this system to the study of mechanosensitive ion channels has been overlooked, perhaps due to a relative abundance of native expression systems. Recent advances, however, have illustrated the advantages of the oocyte system for studying plant and bacterial mechanosensitive channels. Here we describe in detail the methods used for heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive channels in Xenopus oocytes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Frog Surgery</head><p>1. Immerse a frog in the MS-222/NaHCO 3 solution for 10-15 min, until she does not respond to pinching of the skin between the toes. 13 min is optimal in our hands.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Rinse the frog with pretreated animal facility water to remove the anesthetic from its skin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.</head><p>Put the frog on a wet paper towel and perform the surgery with sterile instruments, on a benchtop sterilized by spraying with 70 % ethanol, using sterile gloves. Keep the frog moist with sterile ND96 solution (see Note 4).</p><p>4. Make a small incision through the skin of the abdomen, using sharp scissors, followed by an incision of about 1 cm in the muscle layer. Rinse with ND96. (If the skin is slippery, grasp it with two fingers through a piece of clean paper towel). Place a sheet of Parafilm with a square cut in the middle over the incision, so that oocytes extracted from the abdomen will not come in contact with the surface of the frog's skin.</p><p>2 The advantage of using a pressure clamp machine is that it can be easily integrated into patch-clamp software (such as Clampex, Molecular Devices) and programmed to produce pressure signals of nearly any shape and length that can be synchronized with the applied voltage. Pressure could be also applied to the patch-pipette manually using a syringe. Pressure in this case may be measured using a manometer. 3 Pipettes should be made of alumosilicate or borosilicate glass. Pipettes with thicker walls made of harder glass usually produce lower noise. Additionally, the noise introduced by interactions at the glass-air-water interface could be decreased by coating the pipette tip with a silicone polymer. To do so, place a thin layer of Sylgard (Dow) on the pipette and induce polymerization with a stream of hot air or by contact with a heated metal coil. Capillaries containing an additional thin filament designed to facilitate filling with buffer are not recommended, as they typically result in higher noise levels and "patch creep" (upward movement of the membrane patch within the pipette tip) under applied pressure. <ref type="bibr">4</ref> One may also perform surgery on ice to enhance the anesthetic. Soaking a paper towel in anesthetic solution is not necessary and usually results in longer frog recovery time, but may be recommended for a beginner. Typically the surgery takes 15-20 min, from making the first incision to completed stitching.</p></div>

Tilt the plastic bath 45° from the vertical so that most of the frog's body is submerged in the buffer. Care must be taken that the frog does not drown (keep her nostrils above the water level) but her skin stays wet. When she starts to move in response to pinching, she's almost recovered. Once the frog recovers, return her to a clean cage with fresh water.</p></div>

Conventional single-channel patch-clamp is carried out using pipettes with BN ("bubble number", see ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">38</ref>) of 4-7 in symmetric and asymmetric buffers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.</head><p>Prior to patching, the transparent vitelline membrane of each oocyte should be removed with a pair of sharp forceps after 5-10 min incubation in hypertonic buffer, which makes the cell shrink and the vitelline membrane more visible (see <ref type="bibr">Note 12)</ref>. After removal of the vitelline membrane, the oocyte becomes very fragile, so it should not be exposed to the surface of the buffer and care should be taken when moving it. We suggest removing the vitelline membrane in the petri dish to be used for patch-clamp, already filled with patching bath buffer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3.</head><p>A patch-pipette should be fabricated using a pipette puller (see appropriate manual for measuring glass melting temperature and initial proxy settings that can be adjusted to get the pipette of desired size and shape). Typically, a pipette with tip size between 0.5 and 2 µm is required, which corresponds to BN 4-6 and a resistance of several MΩ, depending on the tips' length and geometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>4.</head><p>The command (or pipette) electrode is a small piece of Ag wire that has been chlorinated either by immersion into 6 % bleach for 15-25 min or by subjecting it to proper potential in KCl buffer <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[ 39 ]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>5.</head><p>The ground electrode is an Ag/AgCl pellet, connected to the ground input of the amplifier's headstage through the common ground (such as a Faraday cage or antivibration table) via Ag wire (see Note 13, Figs. <ref type="figure">3a</ref> and <ref type="figure">4</ref>). It does not matter where the electrode is grounded, only that everything metal be grounded at a single common point, with a stable electrical contact between the wires and grounding point. This can be tested with a standard multimeter. The ground electrode could be immersed into the bath solution directly or via an agar salt bridge (see <ref type="bibr">Note 14)</ref>.</p><p>The Ag/AgCl pellet should be washed with distilled water after experiments are completed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>6.</head><p>Back-fill the patch-pipette with buffer, making sure it is free of air bubbles. If bubbles form, they can sometimes be eliminated by tapping the pipette. Bubbles can be prevented in the first place by pulling some buffer into the empty pipette with a syringe before back-filling the rest of the pipette.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>7.</head><p>Before and during immersion of the pipette into the bath buffer, a positive pressure of 20-30 mmHg should be applied to it. After the pipette tip is immersed, the pressure may be lowered to 5-10 mmHg (see Note 15).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>8.</head><p>Bring the pipette tip close to the oocyte membrane. The state of the pipette tip should be monitored by periodic application of low amplitude square voltage pulses of approximately 5 mV to the command electrode. In Axopatch amplifiers, use the "seal test mode", where steps are gated by the amplifier's internal line frequency oscillator. If the tip resistance grows (the current decreases) before the tip touches the oocyte membrane, replace the pipette, as its tip is likely obstructed with debris.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>9.</head><p>The moment of touching the oocyte membrane is observed electrically as a decrease of the measured current. When it decreases to 2/3-1/2 of its initial value, stop pipette motion and immediately decrease the pressure in the pipette from slightly positive to about -10 mmHg.</p><p>13 It is important that the anti-vibration table, Faraday cage, and microscope with its stage all be in good electric contact, which insures the absence of electric interference from external sources. Our recommendation is to physically connect all pieces with metal wires, preferably in a single place (see Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). Noise levels may be monitored visually with a command electrode attached to the amplifier's headstage via acquisition software; noise should be at least 2-3 times lower than the expected signal from a single channel opening (see patch-clamp amplifier manual for typical acceptable noise levels). Induced low-frequency modulations (50 or 60 Hz) are typically caused by loopbacks and can be eliminated by connecting all power cables to the same noise filter/surge suppressor. In many cases, noise can be reduced with acquisition software suites such as Clampfit (Molecular Devices). However, these approaches may result in partial data loss, and it is preferable to make the initial recording with minimal noise. Note that any additional equipment (such as peristaltic pumps for a perfusion system, manipulators, etc.) most likely will require grounding too. A detailed step-by-step procedure for testing the amplifier's internal noise is usually described in the user manual and should be performed at least once during the initial amplifier setup. It is recommended to repeat this test from time to time during standard use. 14 An agar bridge is an L-shaped glass capillary (the same diameter as used for patch-pipettes and bent in the flame of a gas burner) filled with 2-3 % agar in a 1 M KCl solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[41]</ref>. A heated agar solution is sucked into the capillary and then left to cool. The agar salt bridge should be rinsed with water and kept in salt solution in a fridge as it subject to bacterial invasion. If any signs of bacterial growth are detected, the bridge should be discarded and a new one made. 15 It is also often recommended that during immersion of the tip into the buffer, a stream of air should be applied to the buffer surface by blowing on it. This is intended to move away any debris and fragments of lipid monolayers from the water-air interface.</p><p>10. Observe the gradual formation of the "gigaseal" between the membrane and the pipette as the resistance of the pipettemembrane contact increases to 1 GΩ or more (see <ref type="bibr">Note 16)</ref>. After a gigaseal is reached you have obtained the cell-attached configuration (see <ref type="bibr">Note 17)</ref>. Next, bring the pipette pressure to between -1 and -3 mm Hg.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>11.</head><p>Excise the patch by rapid removal of the pipette away from the oocyte membrane. If the patch is not stable, this may result in patch rupture. Alternatively a membrane vesicle may form in the pipette tip and block it (usually when the pipette is not moved away from the cell quickly enough, see Note 18).</p><p>12. Once the patch is in the "excised" (in this particular case, "inside-out") patch configuration (see Notes 19 and 20 and Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>), one can proceed to stimulation of MSCs. We recommend using a fixed transmembrane voltage of -20 to -40 mV and applying triangular 4-or 5-second-long symmetric ramps of negative pressure to the patch pipette, allowing for the gradual opening and closing of individual MSCs (see <ref type="bibr">Note 21)</ref>. A typical trace obtained from the membrane patch of an oocyte expressing MSL10 from A. thaliana <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[18]</ref> is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref> for reference.</p><p>13. Once a tension-induced channel activity is detected and recorded, be sure to repeat patch excision and current measurement on water-injected oocytes to ensure the absence of artifacts or unusually high endogenous channel activity.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>14.</head><p>We have observed that the localization of the channel usually is not uniform within the oocyte membrane and several patches from the same cell may be necessary to locate channel activity, especially if a small pipette diameter is used.</p><p>15. In our hands, the endogenous cation-selective MSCs that are often observed in the cell-attached configuration inactivate upon patch excision, especially in the presence of elevated MgCl 2 or in TEA-Cl buffer (see Notes 22-24 ).</p><p>16 If this does not happen in a reasonable period of time (30-60 s) or at least a slow but steady growth of patch resistance is not observed, additional suction may be applied to the pipette (usually -20 to -50 mmHg), but it should not be very high as high suction may result in patch rupture (or inactivation for some kinds of MSCs). Additionally, a slightly negative potential (-10 to -20 mV) may be applied to the command electrode to facilitate "sealing" of the patch. 17 At this point, it is already possible to carry out measurements of currents in response to increased membrane tension. However, to remove the complicating contributions of the cell's resting potential, series resistance, and endogenous MSCs we recommend proceeding to the excised patch configuration for further measurements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">18</ref> The production of such a vesicle typically can't be seen through the microscope (unless high magnification and DIC are used), but its formation results in a drop in current in response to high command potentials and the appearance of slow capacitive transient currents in response to voltage steps. Lifting the pipette tip into the air and then immediately immersing it into the bath buffer can disrupt the vesicle. If the vesicle collapses and the new seal is good, one can observe a slight increase of conductance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">19</ref> The inside-out excised patch preserves the orientation of the membrane leaflets-i.e., it is the same as it was in the moment the pipette touched the cell membrane. In certain cases the opposite orientation (when the outer leaflet of the patch faces the bath solution but not the inner volume of the pipette (outside-out configuration)) may be of interest. In order to achieve the outside-out configuration, one should obtain a proper gigaseal in the cell-attached mode and then rupture the patch with a short pulse of either high voltage or negative pressure, thus obtaining direct electric access to the inner volume of the cell (whole-cell mode). Rapid backward removal of the pipette from the cell in this case typically results in the production of a membrane patch in the outside-out configuration. Outside-out patches are often less stable than inside-out patches. 20 The whole-cell mode is not of particular interest for characterization of MSCs in ooctyes due to a very high level of noise (caused by a huge size of the oocyte membrane) and high probability of membrane rupture under applied tension. 21 Membrane tension for the patch in the pipette obeys the law of Laplas and therefore is proportional to transmembrane pressure and curvature radius of the membrane patch. Large patches formed in large pipettes require lower transmembrane pressure in order to be exposed to the same tension as small patches formed in small pipettes.</p><p>16. The rare appearance of an endogenous, large-conductance Ca 2+ -activated chloride channel (see ref. 8) should also be taken into account (see <ref type="bibr">Note 25)</ref>. However, it usually does not present a serious problem as long as small patch-pipettes are used, due to its relatively low expression.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>17.</head><p>A good starting point for recording settings would include the following: (1) acquisition at 20 kHz with the amplifier's low pass filter set to 5-10 kHz (depending on the available settings); (2) a 4-5 s pressure ramp of -20 to -80 mmHg (depending on the pipette size, see Note 26), which in most cases eliminates artifacts caused by a too rapid increase in tension; and (3) a holding potential of 20 mV to 40 mV (pipette voltage) for the inside-out configuration, which typically provides clean and artifact-free traces (see Notes 26 and 27 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>18.</head><p>Once several channels are activated in the patch, one may study the channel's voltage dependence. To do so, repeat the measurement with the same transmembrane pressure but at various potentials (see <ref type="bibr">Note 28)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>19.</head><p>Pressure may be gradually increased by increments of -10 to -40 mmHg in order to activate more channels in the patch and obtain a dose-response curve (see Note 29).</p><p>22 The amount of endogenous MSC activity present in oocytes varies depending on the batch of oocytes, the frog, and the season of the year. Some scientists report that the season with the highest background activity is summer. Endogenous cation-selective MSCs may be inhibited by high concentrations of Mg 2+ ions (see ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">22)</ref> or very low concentrations of lanthanides (approximately 10 μM La 3+ or Gd 3+ ), strong blockers of calcium, potassium and many mechanosensitive channels (see ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">21</ref>). However, it has been shown in the latter case that the inhibition of at least some non-selective MSCs (like MscS) by gadolinium is mediated by membrane lipids and may affect all MSCs at high enough levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[42]</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">24</ref> The formation of a seal between the membrane patch and the pipette occurs more slowly in TEA-Cl buffer. In order to facilitate the process, the concentration of MgCl 2 in the buffer may be increased up to 20 mM. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">25</ref> If this problem persists, the Ca 2+ -activated chloride channel may be inhibited by exclusion of Ca 2+ ions from the buffer, or the addition of chelators or specific blocking agents. If the channels of interest are expected to be cation-selective (or, in some cases, nonselective) large non-permeant molecules such as 2-(N-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) could be used instead of chloride. 26 Membrane potential is defined as the potential of the inner monolayer minus the potential of the outer monolayer, so that the membrane potential of a live cell is negative. For an insideout patch, a positive command potential (i.e., the potential applied through the amplifier to the command electrode in the patch-pipette) corresponds to a negative membrane potential. In case of the outside-out configuration, when the orientation of the monolayers is reversed (i.e., the inside one faces patchpipette), a positive command potential corresponds to a positive membrane potential of the same amplitude. 27 Higher membrane potentials (up to-100 mV for oocytes) on the one hand often result in better signal to noise ratio, but on the other hand may induce the appearance of multiple subconducting states of the channel and always reduce membrane stability. Positive membrane potentials, though they almost never appear in live cells (with an obvious exception of excitable ones), are still of interest as they allow one to characterize a channel's behavior under asymmetric conditions and may provide information on its gating mechanism and even molecular structure. 28 This may be done either by changing the amplifier settings manually before each recording, or by using the software suite programming capabilities. In the latter case, the program will automatically execute several consecutive measurements with different settings (in this case-by changing command potential) and record the data for further analysis. Subsequently, the channel characteristics (such as its conductance) may be extracted from the data file using dedicated or third party software and plotted against membrane potential to produce a current/voltage (I/V)-curve. If the curve goes through zero point (i.e., zero current at zero potential but not zero in the vicinity of 0 mV), the channel is not clearly voltage-gated. Otherwise, the channel requires a certain voltage threshold to open and is, to some degree, voltage-gated. In cases where the I/V-curve is not linear, the channel is considered to be a rectifier, i.e., membrane potential modulates its conductance. 29 If the current saturates (does not increase with tension after certain tension value is reached) one may wish to evaluate the channel's midpoint pressure, the pressure at which a half of the channel population is open, or its threshold tension, the tension at which the very first channel of the population opens. These are distinctive features of a mechanosensitive channel and generally speaking, characterize its tension sensitivity. It should be noted though, that these are statistical values, and several measurements under the same conditions (including membrane patch size) must be carried out in order to obtain an average value and standard deviation. Of course, patches containing more channels produce more reliable values. In our hands, oocytes can survive pressures as high as -160 mmHg with pipettes with BN 4-5, which is enough to reach saturation for MscS <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[17]</ref>. However, the oocyte membrane seems to be more fragile than the membranes of giant E. coli spheroplasts previously used for characterization of MscS <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[14]</ref>.</p></div>

The indications that an oocyte is damaged include, in order of increasing severity: the appearance of bright spots on the animal pole (dark half), blurring of the animal/vegetal pole dividing line, substantially increased cell size, and the appearance of white material extruded from the cell. If the damage is not too severe, patching is still possible as only a small fraction of intact membrane is required.

Another option is to use a tagged version and to detect it via Western blotting (using, for example, the isolation method described in ref.<ref type="bibr" target="#b52">40)</ref>.
