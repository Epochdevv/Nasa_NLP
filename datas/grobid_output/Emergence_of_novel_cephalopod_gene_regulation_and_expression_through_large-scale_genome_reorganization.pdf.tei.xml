<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Coleoid cephalopods (squid, cuttlefish, octopus) have the largest nervous system among invertebrates that together with many lineage-specific morphological traits enables complex behaviors. The genomic basis underlying these innovations remains unknown. Using comparative and functional genomics in the model squid Euprymna scolopes, we reveal the unique genomic, topological, and regulatory organization of cephalopod genomes. We show that coleoid cephalopod genomes have been extensively restructured compared to other animals, leading to the emergence of hundreds of tightly linked and evolutionary unique gene clusters (microsyntenies). Such novel microsyntenies correspond to topological compartments with a distinct regulatory structure and contribute to complex expression patterns. In particular, we identify a set of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) broadly enriched in cephalopod nervous system expression. We posit that the emergence of MACIs was instrumental to cephalopod nervous system evolution and propose that microsyntenic profiling will be central to understanding cephalopod innovations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C</head><p>ephalopods have the largest invertebrate nervous systems and possess many lineage-specific adaptations such as rapid adaptive camouflage, arms with suckers and cameratype eyes. Many cephalopod characteristics evolved convergently to those of vertebrates, which makes them an attractive system to study the genetic basis of wide-scale organismal innovations and the pathways behind their evolution.</p><p>On a genomic level, the emergence of novel genes, extensive gene duplications, and wide-ranging RNA editing have been described in cephalopod genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> . Expansions of gene families such as C2H2s, Protocadherins, and GPCRs, and extensive RNA editing allowed the diversification of protein-coding transcripts in the nervous system and is proposed to have played an important role in its evolution. While similar innovations are known from vertebrate genomes, the mechanisms driving the evolution of these features are different: vertebrates went through several rounds of whole-genome duplications that produced large sets of multi-copy genes and the diversification of their functions, there is no indication for similar events in cephalopods <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> . In contrast, it has been suggested that the coleoid cephalopod (squids, cuttlefish, octopus) lineage went through large-scale genome reorganization <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</p><p>A property of metazoan genomes is that local gene order or microsynteny is conserved between even distantly related species <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> . This conservation is supported by functional studies of regulatory constraints, shown in genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> , as well as co-expression of neighboring genes in tissues or cell types <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Early genome assemblies in several coleoids indicate that local gene order has been greatly disrupted, breaking ancient microsyntenies and bringing previously unlinked genes together <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . This event, potentially at a whole-genome scale, could have affected hundreds of gene families, disrupting the order of genes in comparison to the last common ancestor of coleoid cephalopods and other molluscs. The extent of this event is difficult to estimate due to the lack of chromosomal-scale assemblies in cephalopods. To begin to understand the extent of the genome reorganization and its impact on cephalopod genome biology and evolution, we study the emerging model species Euprymna scolopes (Hawaiian bobtail squid). This species has been at the center of symbiosis research for over 30 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> , but is also an attractive model system for evolution and development research due to its small adult size, large egg clutches, and relative ease of culture.</p><p>To reconstruct the regulatory landscape in the E. scolopes genome, we applied chromosomal conformation capture (Hi-C) and open chromatin profiling techniques (ATAC-seq) as well as collected additional expression data. Hi-C allowed us to both improve the previously published E. scolopes genome assembly as well as to capture the three-dimensional organization of the genome. Using comparative genomic approaches, we describe the global nature of the genome reshuffling in coleoid cephalopods and demonstrate the emergence of many microsyntenic regions that were previously unlinked in other species. Our data also reveals interactions between distant genomic loci (the topological organization of the genome) shedding light on the three-dimensional organization of the E. scolopes genome, as well as identifying genes located in regulatory loops and topologically associating domains (TADs). Our open chromatin data reveals regions accessible to transcription factors and thus potentially constituting regulatory elements. Together, these data allow us to gain insights into the impact of evolutionary changes in gene linkages and the emergence of novel gene regulation. This study provides the basis for the understanding of the evolution of cephalopod genomes and possible implications on morphological novelties in this clade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results and discussion</head><p>The impact of a large-scale genome reorganization on the coleoid cephalopod genome. Linkage information from chromosome conformation capture allowed us to reconstruct 46 chromosomal scaffolds in E. scolopes ("Methods", Supplementary Notes 1 and 2, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>) based on the published assembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . We then compared the order of genes with orthologs found in another 24 animal species ranging from sponges to vertebrates, which allowed us to reconstruct microsyntenic blocks shared between different clades ("Methods", Supplementary Note 3, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, Supplementary Data 1). Briefly, we define microsyntenic blocks as at least three or more co-occurring orthologous genes with up to five intervening genes with no constraints on their collinearity. This definition of microsynteny yields the fewest false-positive blocks (compared to just pairs of genes) while providing enough flexibility to detect syntenic regions that underwent local rearrangement and expansion. We recover 505 microsyntenies unique to cephalopods, representing blocks of genes only found in close proximity to each other in E. scolopes and at least one octopus species. For the same species sampling and same microsynteny detection parameters only 2 blocks would have been expected by chance (median from 3 rounds of randomization, as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> ). Five out of these 505 blocks were paralogous. In total, only 48 out of 2290 genes in these 505 blocks were identified as orphan genes with no homology outside of cephalopods, while all others have orthologs in other animals, suggesting that the origin of microsynteny was due to changes in gene locations rather than novel gene emergence. These microsyntenies have been conserved in coleoid cephalopods despite their long divergence time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>), suggesting an evolutionary constraint that kept those blocks of genes together. Similarly, a comparison in other molluscs, such as the scallop Mizuhopecten yessoensis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and the bivalve Crassostrea gigas showed that a much smaller number of bivalve specific microsyntenies (152) is shared between these species. To infer the set of highly conserved microsyntenic blocks, we reconstructed microsyntenies shared between E. scolopes and at least six more distantly related species out of a set of 23 species (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). We recovered 275 such metazoan microsyntenies, which are retained in the E. scolopes lineage and are inferred to date back to at least the last common bilaterian ancestor (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, "Methods"). In comparison, the bivalve M. yessoensis retains a similar number of metazoan microsyntenies (216). These results provide evidence for a large-scale microsyntenic gain in coleoid cephalopods.</p><p>Chromosomal distribution and properties of metazoan and novel cephalopod microsyntenies. Both cephalopod-specific and conserved metazoan microsyntenic blocks are present on 44 out of 46 chromosomal scaffolds (with two chromosomes being too small to contain any microsyntenies). While some chromosomes have higher proportion of novel cephalopod microsyntenies (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>), both microsynteny types are intermixed in the genome (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1d</ref>). This result suggests a genomewide mechanism for the emergence of novel microsyntenies. The vast majority of single-copy genes (71%) that comprise 232 novel cephalopod microsyntenies are located on different chromosomes in the scallop M. yessoensis. As the organization of the recently published Nautilus genome <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> is similar to other molluscs, these results suggest that either many translocations or chromosomallevel fusions occurred in the coleoid ancestor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Genomic properties of novel and conserved microsyntenies.</head><p>Novel cephalopod and conserved metazoan microsynteny show different genomic properties. Novel cephalopod microsyntenies are on average smaller in size than the metazoan microsyntenies still present in cephalopod genomes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2b</ref>), despite having similar numbers of genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>). While introns of genes in cephalopod-specific microsyntenies are smaller than those of metazoan microsyntenies, the majority of size differences stem from intergenic regions (~0.2 kb compared to ~7 kb difference, respectively).</p><p>We also find evidence for differential enrichment of functional categories between the two microsynteny types. Metazoan microsyntenies <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> are enriched in signaling pathway components of the Wnt-signaling pathway, neurotransmitter transport and synaptic vesicle exocytosis, G-protein coupled receptor signaling, negative regulation of transcription, and BMP signaling pathways, among others. Genes in novel, cephalopod-specific microsynteny, on the other hand, play a role in translation, redox processes, regulation of store-operated calcium entry, mRNA cleavage, transport, and chromatin organization (p-values &lt;0.05) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Spatial organization of the E. scolopes genome. Threedimensional chromatin structure including topologically associated domains (TADs) facilitates distant regulatory interactions involved in gene regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> . While very little data exists todate on invertebrate genome topological organization, we found that in comparison to the data known for vertebrate TAD sizes the interaction distances were generally larger in the squid (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2a</ref>, <ref type="figure">b</ref>, Supplementary Note 4). TAD prediction tools (see "Methods") reveal a median E. scolopes TAD size of 2.5 Mb, in comparison to an average of 1.2 Mb in human <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> . In addition, the distribution of TAD sizes in E. scolopes was considerably wider than in human, suggesting a higher variability.</p><p>In vertebrates, TAD formation is mediated by proteins, such as CTCF and cohesin <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> . We infer that the same mechanisms, including CTCF and the proteins Smc1 and Smc3 of the cohesin complex, are present in the E. scolopes genome and conserved with other animals, suggesting that similar mechanisms may be deployed in cephalopods (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>). We also find TAD boundaries to be enriched for a CCCTC-like motif <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> reminiscent of a CTCF binding site (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2c</ref>, p = 1e-12, "Methods", Supplementary Note 4).</p><p>Topological organization around microsyntenies. Several studies suggested the possibility of correspondence between microsynteny and regulatory domains in metazoan genomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> . To understand the relationship of microsyntenies and TADs we compared the localization of randomly computed microsyntenic blocks, that follow the same properties as our observed blocks but are randomly distributed throughout the genome to the observed microsyntenies ("Methods"). We find a tendency of conserved metazoan microsyntenies to be localized towards the center of the predicted TADs, whereas new cephalopod microsyntenies appear to be more evenly distributed (Fig. <ref type="figure">3a</ref>).</p><p>To further study the relationships of genomic regions and their interactions independent of TAD predictions, we computed a tree structure reflecting the organization of each chromosomal scaffold ("Methods", Supplementary Note 4). Each bifurcating branch reflects the relationships of genomic regions in Hi-C signal strength, allowing us to track interaction intensities in microsyntenies (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). Surprisingly, we found that novel microsyntenies are more likely to form tight interaction regions, reflected by subtrees with few branches, when compared to randomly sampled syntenies (Fig. <ref type="figure">3b</ref>). This result indicates significantly higher levels of compartmentalization in both cephalopod and ancestral microsyntenies.</p><p>Motivated by the importance of three-dimensional genome architecture and microsyntenic co-localization in Euprymna scolopes, three-dimensional modeling based on Hi-C interaction matrices was performed ("Methods", Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>, Supplementary Note 5) to provide a deeper understanding of spatial properties and co-localization of both novel and ancient microsyntenic regions within modeled chromosomal scaffolds. Three-dimensional models revealed that novel cephalopod microsyntenies have distinct spatial properties from ancient microsyntenies. In particular, both synteny types showed differential solvent accessibility on some chromosomes when compared to random distributions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2d</ref>). Moreover, novel cephalopod microsyntenies were on average less buried, thus covering a larger proportion of chromosomal surface (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). This result was in contrast to the conserved metazoan microsyntenies, which tend to participate in the formation of the chromosomal core (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2e</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>). Since the novel microsyntenies are transcriptionally active (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, see below), their location on the chromosomal surface may be reflective of highly dynamic inter-chromosomal regulation, as well as being more accessible to transcription factors.</p><p>The GC content of metazoan and cephalopod-specific microsynteny was evaluated along with predictions of A/B compartments based on the Hi-C interaction matrix ("Methods"). The analysis did not provide sufficient evidence for one of the mycrosyntenic types being more prevalent in either of the compartments. Until further experimental data are available (such as methylation and acetylation profiling) for Euprymna scolopes, we cannot accurately infer the distribution of cephalopod-specific and metazoan microsynteny within A/B compartments.</p><p>Taken together, the strong genomic conservation among sequenced cephalopods, the comparably tight packaging (short inter-gene distances) of microsyntenic clusters and their prevalent association with defined subcompartments within detected TADs suggests strong selective pressure to maintain regulatory properties of novel microsyntenic units in the cephalopod genomes. Co-expression properties of microsyntenies. Co-expression of syntenic genes is an important property that can reflect their regulation. Genes in cephalopod-specific microsyntenies do not tend to be co-expressed, despite their tight co-localization ("Methods", Supplementary Note 7). When compared to randomly sampled groups of genes that follow a similar distribution to the observed, novel microsyntenies, the mean co-expression coefficient is even slightly lower in the observed data (Wilcoxon test, p ≤ 0.05, Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>).</p><p>In contrast, conserved metazoan microsyntenies show significant (Wilcoxon test, p ≤ 0.001) co-expression when compared to simulated microsyntenies (Fig. <ref type="figure">3c</ref>). This result indicates that genes in metazoan microsynteny tend to co-express in a defined set of tissues, similar to previous findings for ancient metazoan microsynteny <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . A similar pattern was also observed for co-expression of novel and conserved metazoan microsyntenies in O. bimaculoides (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7a</ref>). No type of microsynteny showed enrichment of expression-specificity in a particular tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</p><p>To further categorize expression profiles, we investigated averaged expression of syntenic regions. This analysis showed complex patterns that fell into eight distinct expression modules across adult E. scolopes tissues (Fig. <ref type="figure">3d</ref>, "Methods", Supplementary Note 7). Although most modules had similar proportions of both microsynteny types, some clusters formed outliers. For example, module 8 showed eye-specific expression and was mostly dominated by metazoan microsynteny. Interestingly, clusters encompassing multiple nervous tissues, in particular modules 2 and 4, were enriched in novel cephalopod microsyntenies (Fisher's exact test p-values ≤0.02 and ≤1e-07, respectively). Their orthologs were similarly expressed in O. bimaculoides nervous tissues, with novel microsyntenies dominating in modules associated with the strongest brain expression (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7b</ref>). However, the overall module correspondence was impacted by the difference in tissue sampling (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">7c</ref>). We next wanted to investigate whether these expression patterns are biased due to a single highly expressed gene per syntenic block. The vast majority of microsyntenic blocks (76%, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8b</ref>) have one gene that contributes to more than 50% of the cumulative expression. We then calculated relative expression levels across tissues per gene and averaged it for each block, showing that overall expression module identities are retained (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8a</ref>). In general, expression variance correlates with absolute expression of genes (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8c</ref>). In some metazoan syntenies, however, especially in the tissues defining a module, the variance was low, indicating higher co-expression constraints (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">8c</ref>).</p><p>Together, these results highlight the complex expression domain contribution of microsyntenic regions and identifies a discrepancy in the co-expression dynamics between novel cephalopod and metazoan microsyntenies. This paucity of coexpression in cephalopod microsyntenies indicates a potentially different mode of their gene regulation.</p><p>Regulatory signatures of microsyntenies. Expression modules showed specific signatures of regulatory motifs associated with them. We predicted regulatory regions using assay for transposaseaccessible chromatin (ATAC-seq <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> ) data from a developmental time course ("Methods", Supplementary Note 9). Predicted peaks associated with each expression cluster were then further analyzed for known transcription factor motif enrichment, separately for cephalopod and ancient microsynteny ("Methods", Supplementary Data 2). We find that the cephalopod microsynteny module 2, which is associated with multiple nervous tissues, was enriched for the transcription factors binding motifs Chop 26 , E2F1 27 , NeuroG2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> , COUP-TFII <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> , Atf4 30 involved in nervous system differentiation and developmental transcription factors ZBTB18, Esrrb, Tcf21, Pitx1, GATA in all three developmental stages (p &lt; 1e-3). Module 4 was similarly enriched in transcription factor binding motifs involved in nervous system and general development such as Tcf3, TCFL2, GATA, Tcf21, and Pitx1 in all three developmental stages (p &lt; 1e -3). This suggests a common regulatory scheme responsible for gene expression in each of the expression modules and an association of those motifs with novel cephalopod microsynteny.</p><p>To complement our ATAC-seq data, we conducted wholegenome alignments between available cephalopod genomes using different alignment similarity and length thresholds ("Methods", Supplementary Note 8, Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>, and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>). This helped identify potential conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) and their association with gene bodies and genome topology ("Methods", Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>, Supplementary Note 8). Due to evolutionary distance between squid and octopus lineages, our approach yielded only 1187 coleoid cephalopod CNE candidates with a similarity threshold of 0,95 and a minimum size of 100 bp (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>), of which 613 could be localized to gene features (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10a-c</ref>). 139 were associated with novel cephalopod microsyntenies (inside or within 1 kb of microsynteny), 73 with metazoan syntenies inside or within 1 kb of microsynteny), and 401 were located outside any synteny (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10b</ref>). Only 12 of the 1187 candidates had overlap with ATAC-seq peaks (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>). For CNEs shared among squid genomes we found 42920 putative CNEs with a similarity threshold of 0.95 and a minimum size of 100 bp (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref>), of which 13889 could be localized to gene features (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10a-c</ref>). 2444 were associated with novel cephalopod microsynteny (inside or within 1 kb of microsynteny), 3255 with metazoan synteny, and 8190 were located around genes outside any synteny (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10c</ref>). Similarly, very few overlapped with ATAC peaks (14). Therefore, the regulatory role of these regions remains unclear.</p><p>A potential contribution to this observation could be the high evolutionary turnover of regulatory regions within the squid lineage, diminishing the insight gained from genome alignment/ conservation-based inferences. Cephalopod genomes are large with over 50% of genome length attributed to repetitive elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> . We thus assessed the transposable element composition of ATAC-seq peaks associated with microsyntenic clusters. Both microsynteny types showed an average repeat content of 40%.

The ratio (n = 6835) of the number of bins in a cluster and the number of bins in the sub-tree were compared by two sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test comparing the linked groups (****p &lt; 0.0001, * &lt; 0.05, ns: not significant). The closer the ratio to 1, the lower is the difference between the size of the syntenic block and the number of bins in an extracted tree.

The LINE/CR1 expansion was identified as the most common and specifically expanded repeat element class in the squid (E. scolopes) lineage <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</p><p>Evolutionary scenarios for functional microsynteny emergence in cephalopods. Conserved gene co-localization may be explained by regulatory regions within a neighboring gene, even though the function of the gene may be unrelated (the bystander scenario), together forming a genomic regulatory block (GRB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> , or via shared regulatory elements controlling the expression of all syntenic genes, resulting in higher co-expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Our microsynteny approach is agnostic to this distinction, focusing on any conserved co-localization of three or more genes. We thus may use our data to independently profile the propensity of metazoan or cephalopod microsyntenies to correspond to known functional microsyntenic models. The location of ATAC-seq peaks within the microsyntenic clusters reveals that open chromatin regions associated with cephalopod-specific microsynteny were more often found in introns than peaks found in conserved, metazoan microsynteny or other non-syntenic genes (Fig. <ref type="figure">3e</ref>, Fisher's exact test p &lt; 1e-5). Interestingly, while sharing little overlap, CNE distribution, in particular of CNEs shared among squids, showed significant localization towards distal regions in metazoan syntenies (Fisher's exact test p &lt; 2.2e-16) (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10</ref>). This result indicates that, unlike more conserved microsyntenies, novel cephalopod microsyntenies are more similar to the GRB scenario, in particular the bystander model, in which putative enhancers are found within closely located (bystander) genes inside the same microsyntenic cluster and may potentially lack distal regulatory domains. This observation may also complement the finding of weaker co-expression of microsyntenic genes in cepholopod-specific microsynteny, compared to more ancient, conserved microsyntenies.</p><p>Given this insight, we further sought to investigate the potential function of novel cephalopod microsyntenies in expression modules 2 and 4 that showed the highest contribution to neuronal tissue expression domains. Such microsyntenies can be considered a useful test set of functional microsyntenies that were involved in the evolution of the cephalopod nervous system. We thus examined the genomic rearrangement, the regulatory landscape, and expression of genes within one of the representative cephalopod-specific microsyntenies from expression module 2. It was one of the clusters with the highest number of genes, encoding for ceramide-1 phosphate transfer protein, phenylalanine-tRNA ligase, splicing factor 3B subunit, integrator complex subunit, and amyloid protein-binding protein. Orthologs of this microsynteny were widely spread across two chromosomes in scallop (Fig. <ref type="figure">4a</ref>), yet were densely packed in the E. scolopes genome with almost no intergenic space and a few dominant ATAC peaks towards one end of the cluster in the intron of phenylalanine-tRNA ligase (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>). Similar to the general trend, this clustering in cephalopods implies either several local translocations or a large-scale chromosomal fusion, followed by rearrangements. The cluster was localized towards the center of the predicted TAD (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>), close to another novel microsyntenic unit (from the same expression module). Together, these two units form a compartment of high Hi-C interaction density, separate from the closest metazoan microsyntenic compartment and its associated ATAC-peaks (Fig. <ref type="figure">4b</ref>). In our three-dimensional chromosomal model, this microsynteny was also found on the surface of chromosomal scaffold 2 (Fig. <ref type="figure">4c</ref>). Interestingly, the genes in this cluster show nervous system expression both in scallop and E. scolopes (Fig. <ref type="figure">5a</ref>, Supplementary Note 10). Despite some of these genes being considered as purely metabolic or housekeeping genes, in vertebrates they are known to play an important role in nervous system development and activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> . We conducted in situ hybridization to visualize gene expression during development in E. scolopes embryos and confirmed the expression in all major central brain regions (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>, Supplementary Note 11). However, we also revealed expression in other novel cephalopod tissues and organs, such as the axial nerve cords as well as heart and gills (Fig. <ref type="figure">5b</ref>, <ref type="figure">c</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">11</ref>). This result provides evidence that this microsyntenic cluster and its siblings from expression module 2 could comprise functional microsynteny of the bystander model type that were crucial contributors to the emergence of novel cephalopod expression domains. More generally, the observation of microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) and their further investigation could help dissect the evolution of complex cephalopod tissue expression patterns.</p><p>In summary, we present a comprehensive study of topological and regulatory genome organization in a coleoid cephalopod. Characterized by megabase-range interactions, cephalopod genomes have been impacted by a genome-wide syntenic reorganization, with an extent that is rare among animal genomes. This reorganization led to the gain of hundreds of cephalopod-specific microsyntenies that are associated with compact topological regions and a distinct mode of gene regulation. Their putative regulatory sequences were often located within the introns of genes within the same microsyntenic cluster, as has been proposed for functional gene linkage in the bystander model. Our analysis of the microsyntenic expression data revealed complex expression patterns of novel microsyntenies associated with a specific set of cephalopod neural tissues and other novel organs. We identify two such expression modules most prominently affected by the emergence of novel cephalopod microsyntenies, each associated with a specific regulatory signature. We propose that this syntenic 'locking-in', i.e., high compactness and regulatory streamlining, was responsible for the emergence and extension of ancestral molluscan neural tissue expression domains. As much of cephalopod molecular biology remains elusive, our study proposes the use of these microsyntenies associated with cephalopod innovations (MACIs) to begin to unravel molecular changes associated with cephalopod developmental and organismal innovations. This study sets the stage for further investigation of MACIs and their roles in the emergence of novel expression domains and organismal innovations in cephalopods.</p></div>

Paired-end sequencing of 50 bp was done on an Illumina HiSeq2500. Hi-C reads were aligned to the reference genome (excluding scaffolds &lt;50k) resulting in over 106 million valid interaction pairs (alignment rate ~71%). Aligned reads were used to scaffold the genome to chromosomal scaffolds. Assembly statistics are summarized in Supplementary Note 2. Raw Hi-C reads were then again mapped to the new chromosomal scaffolds, recovering over 106 million valid interaction pairs (alignment rate ~71%). Three-dimensional modeling of chromosomal scaffolds is described in Supplementary Note 3. For human samples, Hi-C samples of B-lymphoblastoids were downloaded from NCBI (ref. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> , SRR1658570, HIC001) and aligned to the human reference genome (GRCh38.p12) obtaining over 144 million valid interaction pairs (~73% alignment rate). Synteny analysis. Gene orthology was reconstructed using 27 species spanning all major metazoan clades. Microsynteny was computed using in-house tools as described in detail in Supplementary Note 3.
