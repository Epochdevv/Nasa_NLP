<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>When positioned horizontally, roots grow down toward the direction of gravity. This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is influenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism, a phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin B (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on filamentous-actin (F-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize (Zea mays) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB-and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on a slowly-rotating twodimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism, a process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced F-actin density in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modification of F-actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seedlings expressing genetically encoded F-actin reporters. Like in fixed Z. mays roots, eBL effects on F-actin in living M. truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed a decrease in global F-actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated M. truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Plants are sessile organisms that are limited by their location. As such, they have evolved sensitive and delicate ways to respond to environmental cues allowing them to reprogram their growth when presented with changes in their surroundings. One of the adaptive behaviors that plants exhibit in response to external signals is the ability to redirect the growth of their major organs towards or away from a perceived stimulus. These phenomena, collectively called tropisms, shape the above and belowground architecture of the plant. One of the most widely studied tropisms is gravitropism, which describes the growth of shoots and roots away or toward the gravity vector, respectively. Gravity perception occurs in the columella cells located in the root cap or endodermal cells in shoots. Columella and endodermal cells contain starch-filled amyloplasts, called statoliths, which sediment to the lower side of the cell when the plant is reoriented relative to the gravity vector <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Sack, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Tasaka et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kiss, 2000)</ref>. The physical signal triggered by statolith sedimentation is transduced to the growing regions of the organ resulting in differential growth between the upper and lower sides <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Blancaflor and Masson, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Sato et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Plant organs typically have a defined gravitropic set point angle (GSA). Although the GSA of a specific organ is influenced by the developmental stage of the plant and other environmental cues, it is under tight genetic control allowing for the maintenance of a defined growth angle relative to gravity when other external signals are kept constant. For instance, under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, the main shoot axis typically grows vertically upward (negative gravitropism) with a GSA of 180˚and the primary root grows vertically downward (positive gravitropism) with a GSA of 0˚. Lateral roots and shoot branches typically have a GSA between these values <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Firn and Digby, 1997)</ref>.</p><p>Recently, mechanisms underlying GSA of plant organs that exhibit non-vertical growth, such as lateral roots and shoot branches, have been shown to be dependent on auxin and plant nutritional status <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Roychoudhry et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Roychoudhry et al., 2017)</ref>. Most studies on gravitropism have focused on understanding biological processes that lead to the initial redirection of organ growth when the plant is reoriented. However, gravitropism has been viewed as a composite response that includes restrained or anti-gravity growth readjustment in which the organ eventually straightens after the initial growth redirection. The latter phenomenon is known as autotropic straightening or autotropism <ref type="bibr">(Stankovic et al., 1998a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Stanković et al., 1998b)</ref>. Although it is well established that the initial gravitropic response (i.e. downward root growth and upward shoot growth) is modulated by auxin redistribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Swarup et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Rakusova et al., 2015)</ref>, there is accumulating evidence that most of the major plant hormones participate in gravitropism through overlapping signaling pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Guisinger and Kiss, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lofke et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Vandenbussche et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Pernisova et al., 2016)</ref>. By contrast, little is known about the underlying mechanisms regulating autotropism. It has been debated whether induction of autotropic straightening is triggered by gravity itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Myers et al., 1995)</ref> or as an autonomic counter response to gravitropic bending <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Tarui and Iino, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bastien et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Okamoto et al., 2015)</ref>. It has also been suggested that the term autotropism should be used exclusively in situations when plant organs straighten after withdrawal of the gravity stimulus through randomization of the gravity vector on a clinostat or in microgravity <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Stanković et al., 1998b)</ref>.</p><p>The cytoskeleton has been proposed to play major roles in all phases of gravitropism <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blancaflor, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bisgrove, 2008)</ref>. Microtubules and filamentous-actin (F-actin) are the core protein components of the cytoskeleton, and their dynamics and higher order organization within the cell are defined by many regulatory proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blancaflor, 2013)</ref>. Most studies implicating the cytoskeleton in gravitropism have employed pharmacological approaches in which roots or shoots were exposed to cytoskeletal inhibitors, and the subsequent response of the organ to a horizontal reorientation was quantified <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Blancaflor, 2002)</ref>. Interestingly, such approaches have revealed that chemical inhibitors of F-actin such as latrunculin B (LatB) or cytochalasin B can elicit stronger gravitropic responses in shoots and roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Blancaflor and Hasenstein, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Blancaflor et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hou et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hou et al., 2004)</ref>. The stronger gravitropic response of roots and shoots after treatment with F-actin antagonists was recapitulated in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants disrupted in vegetative actin isoforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kato et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lanza et al., 2012)</ref>. Furthermore, the A. thaliana shoot gravitropic response9 (sgr9) mutant, which had reduced shoot gravitropism and statolith sedimentation, could be rescued by LatB treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Nakamura et al., 2011)</ref>. Recently, delayed root gravitropism in A. thaliana actin-related protein 3 (arp3) mutants was linked to abnormal amyloplast sedimentation and bundled F-actin in the columella cells. The delay in root gravitropism was reversed by LatB exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Zhou et al., 2016)</ref>. It was postulated that actin disruption promoted gravitropism by increasing gravity sensing potential through unimpeded statolith sedimentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blancaflor, 2013)</ref>. However, this hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally.</p><p>As noted, gravitropism is modulated by most of the major plant hormones, but in the context of past actin inhibitor studies, brassinosteroid is the plant hormone that is of most interest. Like LatB, eBL promoted gravitropism in shoots and roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Meudt, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kim et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Li et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim et al., 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lanza et al., 2012)</ref>. The effect of eBL on root gravitropism was explained primarily through its interaction with auxin <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kim et al., 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kim et al., 2007)</ref>. In A. thaliana, eBL induced the accumulation of the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED 2 (PIN2) protein in the root elongation zone <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Li et al., 2005)</ref>. The effect of eBL on PIN2 accumulation was proposed to involve the actin cytoskeleton through an increase in the expression domains of ROP2 (for Rho of Plants), a small GTPase regulator of F-actin dynamics <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Li et al., 2005)</ref>. Furthermore, it was shown that exogenous eBL treatment altered both actin organization and PIN2 polar localization in A. thaliana roots in a manner similar to that of auxin <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lanza et al., 2012)</ref>. Taken together, the actin cytoskeleton appears to be a component of the signaling pathways by which eBL promotes gravitropic growth responses in plants.</p><p>The promotive effect of LatB and eBL on gravitropism has been explained primarily in regard to their impact on gravity sensing events or on the differential growth responses resulting from altered auxin redistribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hou et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Hou et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Li et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lanza et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blancaflor, 2013)</ref>. However, a recent study with A. thaliana mutants disrupted in genes encoding the actin motor protein myosin presents an alternative hypothesis to explain the LatB-or eBL-induced enhancement of root gravitropism. The apparent promotion of tropistic organ responses brought about by altered actin function may instead be due to its inhibition of the autotropic straightening response <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Okamoto et al., 2015)</ref>. In the study by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Okamoto et al. (2015)</ref>, inflorescence stems of A. thaliana myosin XI mutants bent strongly when the initial gravity stimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation, an observation that mirrored the persistent curvature of Z. mays roots treated with LatB <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hou et al., 2003)</ref>. Here, we show that eBL-treated roots exhibited persistent curvature responses when the initial gravity response was withdrawn by clinorotation in a similar manner as LatBtreated roots. Our results indicate that the apparent promotion of root gravitropism by eBL can be explained by its inhibitory effect on autotropic straightening that resulted, in part, from eBLmediated alterations in F-actin dynamics and organization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Zea mays Root Growth and Drug Treatments</head><p>Maize (Zea mays L. cultivar Merit) seeds were soaked for 10 to 12 h in deionized water. After soaking, seeds were planted side by side with the embryo facing down on 45 × 35 cm opaque plastic trays lined with moist germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co. USA). The seeds were covered with a second layer of germination paper and gentle pressure was applied to the paper so that surface tension between the two sheets of paper held the seeds in place. A second opaque plastic tray was placed on top of the first tray so that the two layers of germination paper containing the seeds were secured between the two trays. The trays were oriented vertically in a plastic tub filled with water to a depth of 5-10 cm to keep the germination paper moist. After 48 h, seedlings with 1-2 cm long straight primary roots were selected and treated with working solutions of LatB, eBL or the corresponding solvent control, which consisted of diluted dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To treat roots, a set-up consisting of 1.5 ml microfuge tubes oriented vertically on microfuge holders was prepared. The center of the lid of the microfuge tube was punctured with the tip of a heated metal probe to create a 2 mm diameter hole, and 1 ml of the treatment solution was added to each tube. Selected seedlings were transferred one at a time to each microfuge tube by inserting the roots into the hole so that 20 mm of the root tip was immersed vertically in the solution. Seedlings were stabilized during treatment by mounting the kernel to the microfuge tube with caulking compound. Roots were incubated with 100, 250, 500, and 1,000 nM LatB and eBL and DMSO controls using this set-up for 1 h. Soaking, germination and treatment was done in a Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) set to 24°C with 14 h (120 mmoles m -2 s -1 )/10 h day/night cycle.</p><p>Stock solutions of LatB (1mM; Calbiochem, USA) and eBL (10 mM; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) were prepared with 100% (v/v) DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and stored at -20°C prior to use. Working solutions were prepared by adding the appropriate volume of stock solution to sterile de-ionized water.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Z. mays Clinorotation Assays</head><p>After treatment, five seedlings were selected from each treatment group and mounted on 10 × 10 cm square Petri dishes with double-sided foam tape. The lid of the Petri dish was lined with two layers of wet germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co., USA) to maintain high humidity. The Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and mounted on a custom-built two-dimensional (2-D) clinostat located in the same Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) used for seed germination and root treatment. The Petri dishes were first mounted so that the roots were vertical (Appendix 1). After 60 min the Petri dishes were rotated by 90°so that roots were in a horizontal position. After 20 min, the clinostat was activated and roots were rotated for 20 h at 1 revolution per minute (RPM). Digital images of the roots after clinorotation were captured using a camera mounted on a copy stand. Each treatment was replicated three times using a total of 15-20 seedlings. Root curvature was measured using ImageJ software (<ref type="url" target="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.  nih.gov/ij/</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Time-Lapse Imaging of Graviresponding Z. mays Roots</head><p>Another set of Z. mays seedlings was treated with 100 nM LatB, 500 nM eBL and the solvent control solution and mounted on square Petri dishes following the methods described above. The plates were positioned so that the roots were in a vertical orientation. After 60 min, the plates were rotated 90°so that the roots were horizontal. Immediately after rotation, images were captured every 15 min for 12 h. Time-lapse movies were generated using the Metamorph 5.0 image acquisition software (Universal Imaging Corp, USA). From the generated time-lapse movies, the root tip angle with respect to the horizontal was measured using ImageJ software. Experiments were repeated at least three independent times with 15-20 seedlings per treatment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>F-Actin Labeling and Confocal Microscopy of Fixed Z. mays Roots</head><p>Labeling and imaging of F-actin was essentially as described by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dyachok et al. (2016)</ref>. Briefly, the apical 5 mm of roots incubated in LatB, eBL and the corresponding solvent control for 1 h were fixed in 50 mM piperazine-N,N ′ bis [2-ethansesulfonic acid], 2 mM MgCl 2 , and 10 mM ethylene glycol-bis(b-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid pH 7.0 (PME buffer) containing 5% DMSO and 2% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, USA). After roots were washed with PME buffer, they were sectioned at a thickness of 70 mm using a Vibratome 1500 (Ted Pella Inc., USA). F-actin in the root sections was labelled with Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, USA) suspended in PME buffer. After mounting sections on glass slides, they were imaged with an inverted Leica TCS-SP8-X confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) equipped with a 63× oil-immersion objective. Alexa-Fluor was excited with the 488 nm line of the white light laser and emission was detected at 522 nm. To enhance the resolution of F-actin images obtained from fixed roots for downstream quantitative analysis, the HyVolution deconvolution package (Huygens, The Netherlands) was used to process image data directly acquired with the Leica SP8-X system. Five optical sections taken at 0.5 mm intervals were acquired. Each dataset was then processed using the wizard-driven HyVolution user interface linked with the Leica Application Suite (LAS) software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Generation of M. truncatula Plants Expressing Fluorescent Protein-Based F-Actin Reporters</head><p>Transgenic M. truncatula lines expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP and UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP were generated essentially as described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Jiang et al. (2019)</ref>. Briefly, Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA 105 harboring Lifeact and ABD2 constructs were streaked on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50 mg ml -1 kanamycin and 25 mg ml -1 rifampicin and cultured at 28°C for 2-3 days. A single colony was picked and then cultured in LB liquid media containing the same antibiotics for 16 h or until the OD600 was 0.6-0.8. The trifoliates located second from the top were collected from 4-6 week-old M. truncatula R108 plants grown at 24/20°C and 16/8 h day/night. The leaves were sterilized with 20% commercial bleach containing a drop of Tween-20 for 10 min and then washed three times with sterile water. The leaves were then infected with the A. tumefaciens suspension that was generated by centrifuging the A. tumefaciens liquid culture at 3,500 rpm for 20 min and then resuspending the pellets in liquid infection medium to an OD600 of 0.2-0.3. The infection procedure included a 10-min vacuum infiltration, a 3-5 min sonication and then another 10-min vacuum infiltration. After this, the infected leaves were blot dried and plated on co-cultivation medium. The trifoliate explants were transferred onto selection medium containing 10 mg ml -1 hygromycin after 24-30 h incubation under 24°C in the dark. Culture of the explants continued for an additional 5-6 weeks under the same conditions or until enough resistant calli were produced. The resistant calli were then transferred onto shoot regeneration medium and cultured under 150 mmoles m -2 s -1 light at 24/20°C and 16/8 h day/night cycle. After 2-3 months, plantlets were fully regenerated with functional roots. A couple of leaflets were sampled from the regenerated plants for DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide. DNA samples were PCR amplified with primers for hygromycin B phosphotransferase gene (forward 5'-AAGGAATCGGTCAATACACTACATGG -3' and reverse 5'-AAGACCAATGCGGAGCATATACG -3'). Confirmed transgenic plants were then screened using a fluorescent stereo microscope and those with GFP signal were transferred to soil and allowed to go to seed. Multiple, independent lines of both UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP, and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were screened in the subsequent generations until homozygous positive lines were obtained.</p></div>

Next, seeds were sterilized with 6% (v/v) sodium hypocholorite in 50 ml Falcon tubes (Corning, USA) for 10 min in room temperature, with intermittent rotation. Postincubation, the seeds were rinsed six times with sterile deionized water and were spread out on 10% (w/v) agar (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) plates in 100 × 25 mm round petri dishes. Seeds were stratified for 2 days in the dark at 4°C. Plates were flipped upside-down and seeds were germinated by transferring them to a 24°C incubator for 20 h. Six seedlings with straight radicles that emerged into the air were selected and transferred onto a 10 ×10 cm square plates containing 10% (w/v) agar (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for subsequent treatment with germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co., USA) that was pre-soaked with either 100 nM LatB, 5 mM eBL or DMSO solvent control.

Once the agar had set, half of the agar was cut and removed from the plate with a razor blade. In addition, six shallow indentations for the cotyledons of six seedlings was cut with a razor blade. Each seedling was fitted into its respective indentation, with its cotyledon held by the agar and its radicle suspended into the air in the plate. Next, 52°C molten agar was pipetted on the cotyledons to hold each seedling firmly in its location. After growing seedlings vertically for 1 h, the plates were rotated 90°for 20 min followed by clinorotation for 15 h at 1 rpm on the clinostat. Post-treatment, images of the roots were taken using a camera mounted on a copy stand and root curvature was measured using ImageJ software.</p><p>To image F-actin, 2-day-old seedlings with straight roots were transplanted onto 64 × 48 mm cover slips coated with a 2 mm thick slab of 1% agar.

The lifted agar was then used to hold the root in place so that it lay between the agar and coverslip. Roots treated with LatB and eBL for 1 h were imaged immediately. Another set of transplanted seedlings was used to evaluate the quality of F-actin labeling in non-treated seedlings. For this set of seedlings, the cover slip with transplanted seedlings was placed in a 9 cm round Petri dish and transferred to the same Conviron (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) used for Z. mays clinostat assays. The Petri dishes were tilted at an angle of 60°to enable the root to grow close to the bottom surface of the coverslip.

The enhancement of gravitropic response in LatB-treated roots was more strongly manifested on a slowly-rotating 2-D clinostat. For instance, Z. mays roots treated with LatB displayed persistent root curvature on the clinostat, as opposed to untreated roots that straightened <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hou et al., 2003)</ref>. We hypothesized that the enhanced gravitropism of eBL-treated roots was likely to also be more prominent under clinorotation. Our experiment involved applying a perpendicular gravistimulus to roots for 20 min after pre-treating them for an hour with LatB or eBL followed by clinorotation for 20 h (Appendix 1). We found that eBL-treated roots mirrored the persistent curvature responses of LatB-treated roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hou et al., 2003)</ref>. Quantification of the angle of root curvature that developed on the clinostat revealed that LatB was more potent than eBL when tested at the same concentrations. For instance, LatB induced a strong curvature response at 100 nM concentration, whereas eBL elicited a similar curvature at a higher 500 nM concentration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>).</p><p>Next, we compared the kinetics of gravitropism of Z. mays roots pretreated for 1 h with 100 nM LatB or 500 nM eBL under continuous gravistimulation (i.e. roots reoriented 90°from the vertical without clinorotation). We found that roots treated with the solvent control solution grew downward and reached a maximum angle of about 80°from the horizontal at approximately 200 min. Control roots maintained this angle for the entire 720 min time course. By contrast, LatB-and eBLtreated roots overshot the vertical and reached maximum angle of approximately 110°after 250 min (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). Overshooting of the vertical by LatB-and eBL-treated roots was followed by a correction to the vertical that began at about 300 min after orienting roots horizontally. Although both LatB-and eBLtreated roots exhibited similar kinetics with regard to their overshooting of the vertical, the subsequent overcorrection was more pronounced in eBL-treated roots. eBL-treated roots returned to an angle of about 60°at 450 min after gravistimulation, but eventually stabilized to a 90°growth angle by about 600 min. At the end of the 720 min time course, eBL-treated roots reached a similar angle as controls.</p><p>By contrast, LatB-treated roots returned to about 90°at 450 min and maintained this growth angle for the duration of the time course (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Epi-Brassinolide Modifies F-Actin Organization in Z. mays Roots</head><p>The similar effects of LatB and eBL on maize root gravitropism and autotropic root straightening on a 2-D clinostat (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) led us to hypothesize that eBL may cause LatB-like effects on the actin cytoskeleton. To test this hypothesis, we studied F-actin organization in maize roots that were treated with LatB and eBL at concentrations that produced comparable root phenotypes (i.e.100 nM for LatB and 500 nM for eBL). After exposure to the compounds, roots were chemically fixed, sectioned and F-actin was labeled with phalloidin conjugated to a fluorophore <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dyachok et al., 2016)</ref>. Consistent with our previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hou et al., 2003)</ref>, distinct qualitative differences in F-actin organization were observed between roots treated with solvent controls and roots treated with 100 nM LatB in the meristem, transition zone and elongation zone. Whereas controls had extensive F-actin networks in various root developmental zones, LatB-treated roots had diffuse labeling or severely fragmented F-actin manifested primarily as bright puncta (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). By contrast, roots treated with 500 nM eBL still had abundant F-actin networks in the various root developmental zones that appeared similar to control roots. Since roots treated with 500 nM eBL did not show obvious qualitative differences in F-actin organization compared with control roots, we increased the eBL treatment concentration to 1 and 5 µM. Nonetheless, even after treatment with 1 µM eBL, F-actin in various regions of the root appeared similar to untreated roots. Qualitative disruptions to F-actin only became obvious when eBL concentration was increased to 5 µM. At this concentration some root cells had diffuse fluorescence and fragmented F-actin that resembled LatB-treatment to some degree (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). However, unlike LatB-treated roots, roots treated with 5 µM eBL contained more cells with intact F-actin networks that were similar to untreated roots. This result suggested that while eBL disrupts actin, its effects were milder than LatB.</p><p>To quantify the effect of LatB and eBL on the root F-actin networks, we acquired occupancy values from images of root de Bang et al.</p><p>Brassinosteroids Modulate Root Autotropism cells within the transition and elongation zone. We focused on these root zones because they have been shown to contribute most to the differential growth during the gravity response <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Baluska et al., 1996)</ref>. Occupancy is a quantitative metric used to depict F-actin density with higher values indicating a denser Factin network <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Higaki et al., 2010b)</ref>. Compared with controls, occupancy of F-actin in roots treated with 100 nM LatB, 500 nM eBL, and 5 µM eBL was lower. Surprisingly, F-actin occupancy was significantly higher in roots treated with 1 µM eBL compared to control roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Taken together, our results show that eBL modifies F-actin organization in maize roots by causing a significant reduction in density. However, unlike roots treated with LatB, which showed more widespread disruption of F-actin, roots treated with eBL required higher concentrations (i.e. 5 µM) to detect distinct qualitative and quantitative effects on F-actin structure. Even at this higher concentration, impacts on F-actin appeared to be localized to random regions of the root (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>).</p><p>Another metric that we used to quantify eBL effects on F-actin structure is skewness, which measures the degree of asymmetry of fluorescence intensity distribution. Skewness has been shown to be a good indicator of F-actin bundling <ref type="bibr">(Higaki et al., 2010a)</ref>. We found that while LatB treatment resulted in a small but significant increase in bundling, eBL at all concentrations, did not (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP Reporters Decorate Extensive F-Actin Networks in Living M. truncatula Seedlings</head><p>Our studies on chemically-fixed roots of Z. mays, support the hypothesis that the effects of eBL on root gravitropism and autotropic straightening on a 2-D clinostat are due to disruptions in normal actin function (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). However, the results indicate that eBL only had modest effects on overall F-actin organization based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of chemically-fixed Z. mays roots (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-C</ref>). Therefore, we next asked if effects of eBL on F-actin would be more obvious in living roots. To address this question, transgenic M. truncatula plants that expressed two live cell F-actin reporters (Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP) under the control of the ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10) promoter were generated <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Wang et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Vidali et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dyachok et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sparks et al., 2016)</ref>. Before using the lines for clinorotation assays, we first examined the quality of F-actin labeling in seedling roots. We found that Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP decorated extensive F-actin networks in various developmental regions of seedling roots. Distinct Factin arrays were present in border cells, meristematic cells and cells in the transition/elongation zone. Similar to previous reports in A. thaliana, both Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP reporters labeled end walls and phragmoplasts in the meristem, and random and longitudinal F-actin cables in the elongation zone of M. truncatula seedling roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). In agreement with previously published work with fixed and living roots, both reporters did not label distinct F-actin networks in the columella despite the presence of clear F-actin bundles in the peripheral cap and border cells. Only diffuse fluorescence was observed in the central columella of both reporter lines (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Baluska et al., 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Blancaflor, 2013)</ref>. Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP also labeled extensive F-actin arrays in growing root hairs that were reminiscent of F-actin organization in A. thaliana lines expressing these two reporters (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dyachok et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Sparks et al., 2016)</ref>. Moreover, other cell types in transgenic lines expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP and Lifeact-mGFP including guard cells, minor leaf veins and epidermal cells in nodules exhibited dense F-actin arrays (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C-E</ref>). Although primary root length and growth rate of 5-day-old M. truncatula seedlings expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP were similar to wild type (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3F</ref>, <ref type="figure">G</ref>), dry weights of the same lines at 28 days were lower compared to wild type (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3H</ref>, <ref type="figure">I</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Epi-Brassinolide Triggers Enhanced Root Curvature Responses in M. truncatula on a Clinostat, But Only Had Mild Effects on F-Actin Organization</head><p>We next asked if eBL could elicit similar enhancement of root curvature responses in M. truncatula on a clinostat that was previously observed in Z. mays roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). As 5 mM eBL was required to observe clear effects on F-actin in chemicallyfixed Z. mays roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>), we used the same concentration for the M. truncatula clinostat assays. Furthermore, we focused our clinostat assays on lines expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP. The GFP-ABD2-GFP lines were chosen for our root clinostat assays because F-actin in the transition and elongation zone was finer and less bundled compared to Lifeact-mGFP lines, an observation consistent with previous work on A. thaliana <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dyachok et al., 2014)</ref>. Consistent with previous reports, LatBtreated M. truncatula roots expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP exhibited enhanced curvature on a clinostat (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hou et al., 2003)</ref>. Like in Z. mays roots, eBL treatment caused M. truncatula roots to curve strongly on a clinostat (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>). Although, enhanced curvature on a clinostat was observed in LatB-and eBL-treated M. truncatula roots, the final average curvature was less than that observed in Z. mays (Compare Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>Having established that M. truncatula roots expressing the GFP-ABD2-GFP F-actin reporter exhibited enhanced curvature on a clinostat, we then asked if F-actin organization in living roots was modified by eBL. We focused our analyses on root cells within the transition and elongation zone. Consistent with observations in chemically-fixed Z. mays roots, F-actin in M. truncatula roots expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP was clearly disrupted after treatment with 100 nM LatB. While root epidermal cells in the elongation zone of untreated roots had extensive cortical F-actin networks, F-actin in the same region after 1 h exposure to 100 nM LatB were less dense and fragmented (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). Moreover, F-actin in live M. truncatula roots treated with LatB had lower occupancy values, which corroborated results with chemically fixed Z. mays roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>). Experiments with eBL were less conclusive, particularly with regard to the impact on F-actin density. Surprisingly, F-actin in roots treated with 5 µM eBL had intact cortical F-actin networks that were qualitatively similar to untreated roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5A</ref>). Quantitative analysis showed that F-actin occupancy values were consistent with the observation that 5 µM eBL had no significant effects on F-actin density in living roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>). Furthermore, while F-actin skewness increased in LatB-treated roots, this metric was not affected by 5 µM eBL (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5C</ref>).</p><p>Next, we asked if eBL had other measurable quantitative impacts on F-actin organization in living M. truncatula roots.</p><p>For this analysis, the degree of orientation of F-actin in root cell images was analyzed using a metric called eccentricity. Lower eccentricity values indicate a more disordered F-actin network. Modified cortical F-actin eccentricity was reported in Physcomitrella patens ROP4 RNA interference (RNAi) lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Burkart et al., 2015)</ref>. Using metrics developed by <ref type="bibr">Burkhart et al. (2015)</ref>, we found that F-actin in living M. truncatula roots treated with 100 nM LatB and 5 µM eBL had significantly lower eccentricity values than F-actin in untreated roots. This result indicated that both LatB and eBL treatments led to more disordered F-actin (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>). </p></div>

For these experiments, epidermal cells of etiolated barrel medic seedlings expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were used for analyzing F-actin dynamics. We used lines expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP for these analyses because the F-actin arrays in hypocotyls of these lines were more readily visualized than those expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP. Roots were not used for this analysis because they grew out of the field of view within the desired 1 min period required for global actin dynamics analysis. Furthermore, the thick roots from M. truncatula were difficult to keep in the same focal plane during imaging, which complicated the interpretation of results.</p><p>Cortical F-actin in M. truncatula hypocotyls were captured every second for 1 min and movies were used to quantify global changes in F-actin following the metrics developed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Vidali et al.

These metrics included pixel difference values that capture intensity differences between images every second, and correlation coefficients that indicate the degree of change (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref>). A larger difference between pixels over time and a steeper decay in the correlation coefficient indicated a more dynamic F-actin network <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Vidali et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dyachok et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Burkart et al., 2015)</ref>.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In this paper, a slowly-rotating 2-D clinostat was used to gain additional insights into actin-mediated regulation of directional root growth. These experiments showed that brassinosteroids were involved in modulating directional root growth, in part, by modifying the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. This conclusion was based on the observation that exogenous application of eBL and LatB triggered similar enhanced root gravitropism and amplified root coiling on a clinostat (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The curvature responses of roots treated with eBL and LatB during continuous gravistimulation and on a clinostat are reminiscent of the behavior of inflorescence stems of A. thaliana myosin XI and actin8 mutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kato et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Okamoto et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Talts et al., 2016)</ref>. The hyperbending of inflorescence stems of myosin and actin A. thaliana mutants was proposed to be the result of inhibited autotropism. With an aberrant acto-myosin system in fiber cells, it was proposed that the stems could no longer perceive their posture to initiate a straightening response <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Okamoto et al., 2015)</ref>. Here, we propose that a similar mechanism may be operating in roots, and that eBL is a component of the root organ straightening response through its impacts on F-actin.</p><p>Most of the studies implicating the actin cytoskeleton in gravitropism have emphasized its role in the gravity perception phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blancaflor, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Su et al., 2017)</ref>. In gravity sensing cells such as the columella, actin has been proposed to interact with amyloplasts to facilitate conversion of the physical gravity signal to a biochemical signal <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(Zheng et al., 2015)</ref>. Because actin inhibitors such as LatB or mutations to genes encoding actin itself led to stronger root gravitropic curvature <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Hou et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Kato et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lanza et al., 2012)</ref>, it was proposed that the unrestrained sedimentation of amyloplasts may amplify the gravity sensing signal leading to a more robust graviresponse <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Blancaflor, 2013)</ref>. However, work on A. thaliana myosin XI mutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Okamoto et al., 2015)</ref> and results presented here, suggest a more prominent role for actin in the graviresponse phase, and more specifically in the autotropic straightening response that enables plant organs to correct their orientation <ref type="bibr">(Stankovic et al., 1998a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Stanković et al., 1998b)</ref>.

For instance, eBL application mirrored the enhanced root waving and gravitropism of A. thaliana actin2 mutants and caused disruptions in F-actin configurations in wild type <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lanza et al., 2012)</ref>. Enhanced root gravitropism was also observed in wild-type A. thaliana roots treated with eBL and this process was proposed to be mediated by ROP2-dependent modification of F-actin assembly and disassembly <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Li et al., 2005)</ref>. While our results expand on these previous observations, experiments with a clinostat implicated eBL as a potential regulator of autotropism, and like previous results with LatB-treated roots, provide an alternative explanation of why this hormone has an apparent promotive effect on gravitropism. Although previous studies have shown that eBL modifies Factin organization in A. thaliana roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Lanza et al., 2012)</ref>, we found that eBL effects on F-actin organization in fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots were not as pronounced and consistent as those induced by LatB. Higher concentrations of eBL were needed to elicit distinct qualitative and quantitative changes in F-actin in both chemically-fixed Z. mays roots and living M. truncatula roots. In fact, it was surprising to find that 1 µM eBL led to increased F-actin occupancy values compared to controls, while concentrations lower (500 nM) or higher (5 µM) than 1 µM led to reduced values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). Moreover, F-actin occupancy and bundling in living roots treated with 5 µM eBL was not different from untreated controls (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>, <ref type="figure">C</ref>). LatBtreatment on the other hand, led to an increase in F-actin bundling, which was likely due to aggregation of F-actin fragments in some of the root cells analyzed. Although occupancy and bundling were not affected by eBL, we found that eccentricity of F-actin in LatB-and eBL-treated roots were reduced relative to controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>). It is tempting to speculate that eBL-induced reduction in F-actin alignment alone is sufficient to account for a large part of the root autotropic inhibition observed here. It is important to note, however, that all of the F-actin analyses reported here were conducted pre-clinorotation. It is possible that changes in F-actin organization during the process of clinorotation were unaccounted for in our analyses. Experiments involving chemically fixing roots at various time points during clinorotation or a system in which live roots expressing the Factin reporters can be imaged on a clinostat, will be necessary to address such possibilities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Okamoto et al. (2015)</ref> proposed that the long F-actin cables in the inflorescence stem fiber cells were the structures that modulated organ straightening possibly by regulating cytoplasmic streaming. It is possible that eBL regulation of root autotropic straightening is facilitated by a population of F-actin in specific root cell types that are not detected by the quantitative metrics used in our studies. This could explain why eBL had only modest effects on overall F-actin organization, but still caused LatB-like autotropic straightening defects. Another possibility is that dampening of global F-actin dynamics by eBL as revealed by live cell imaging of etiolated M truncatula hypocotyls could account for autotropic straightening defects. Suppressed global F-actin dynamics after eBL exposure could de Bang et al.</p><p>modify targeting of plasma membrane-associated proteins, such as PIN2, leading to dampened autotropism <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Li et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Lanza et al., 2012)</ref>. Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain global Factin dynamic data on M. truncatula root cells because of technical difficulties associated with keeping actively growing roots within the microscope field of view. As such, a direct link between root F-actin dynamics and root autotropism is missing. For the future, a suitable clinostat assay using M. truncatula shoots should help clarify if reduced global F-actin dynamics can explain eBL effects on organ straightening. Furthermore, live fluorescent protein-based F-actin marker lines in Z. mays could help strengthen the link between F-actin organization and autotropic organ growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Wu et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>For more than a decade, genetically-encoded F-actin reporters based on fluorescent protein technology have advanced our understanding of actin function during plant development <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Voigt et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Wang et al., 2008)</ref>. In addition to new insights into the processes underlying directional root growth control, our work introduces a set of M. truncatula lines expressing two types of genetically encoded F-actin reporters. These new F-actin reporter lines could potentially be used to address a range of biological questions. Specifically, a future gravitational biology-related study in which these new M. truncatula lines would be of value is the dynamic monitoring of F-actin in various tissues of graviresponding roots using vertical stage microscopy <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Von Wangenheim et al., 2017)</ref>. Vertical stage microscopy combined with new imaging modalities such as airy scan should enable super-resolution of F-actin during plant gravity response <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Komis et al., 2018)</ref>. Moreover, some light sheet microscopy platforms allow for plant organs to be positioned vertically. Such methods pave the way for long term and volumetric imaging of F-actin dynamics during plant gravity response using these new M. truncatula lines <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Ovečka et al., 2018)</ref>. Similar to previous reports in A. thaliana plants expressing live cell F-actin reporters <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Ketelaar et al., 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Dyachok et al., 2014)</ref>, mature M. truncatula plants expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP appear to have growth defects based on their reduced shoot and root dry weights when compared to controls. However, the negative growth effects induced by expressing these reporters were mild and not very pronounced in young seedlings. Thus, if used with caution, these Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP M. truncatula lines should be a valuable addition to existing fluorescent protein-based toolkit for studying dynamic cellular processes in legumes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ivanov and Harrison, 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Cvrckova and Oulehlova, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Zhang et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results implicate brassinosteroids in root autotropism. Brassinosteroids modulate this process by modifying F-actin organization and dynamics in a manner different from that of the actin-disrupting compound LatB. Regardless of the mechanisms by which eBL modifies F-actin, our studies reinforce previous observations that the acto-myosin system is an important component of plant tropistic responses.</p><p>Finally, through our work, we introduced a set of M. truncatula lines expressing fluorescent protein-based reporters that could enable new studies of actin-mediated processes in legumes.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIGURE 1 |</head><label>1</label><figDesc>FIGURE 1 | Epi-Brassinolide (eBL) and LatB enhanced gravitropism and dampened straightening of Z. mays roots.
