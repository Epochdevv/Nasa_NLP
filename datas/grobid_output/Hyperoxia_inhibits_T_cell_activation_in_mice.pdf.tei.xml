<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A C T Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, the abnormal proliferate and differentiate ability of type II epithelial cells (AEC II) is the key to the pathological basis of BPD. Mechanisms regarding abnormal AEC II in BPD remain unclear. The present work investigated the role and mechanisms of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in lung disorder in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxiainduced BPD mouse model and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system. Firstly, we found that the NKT cells development factor IL-15 increased over time in patients with BPD in public databases, and clinically collected peripheral blood NKT cells in patients with BPD were increased. Subsequently, the percentage of iNKT cells increased in hyperoxia group compared with normoxia group, with the highest at P7, accompanied by increased activation with abnormal lung development. The administration of anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody to inhibit iNKT cells could alleviate the abnormal lung development of hyperoxia group mice, while α-GalCer administration could aggravate lung injury in hyperoxia group mice, and adoptive transfer of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal lung development in hyperoxia group mice. In addition, to further verify the role of iNKT cells on AEC II, AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system was established. The presence of iNKT cells could aggravate the abnormal expression of SP-C and T1α under hyperoxia. Meanwhile, RNA-seq analysis showed that ferroptosisrelated genes were highly expressed in AEC II co-cultured with iNKT cells under hyperoxia. We further validated the effect of the presence of iNKT cells under hyperoxia environment on AEC II ferroptosis levels, suggested that iNKT cells promote AEC II ferroptosis under hyperoxia, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Our study found that the recruitment of iNKT cells in the lung may be an important cause of alveolarization disorder in BPD.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease characterized by immature lung development that affects almost half of extremely preterm infants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Decreased alveolar number, simplified alveolar structure, and accompanying vascular lesions are features of BPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. Hyperoxia can induce BPD phenotype and change the composition of cellular compartments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II) are the main stem cells of the lung and maintain normal lung function <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. When the lung is damaged, AEC II have a role in replacing abnormal and damaged alveolar epithelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In particular, the abnormal ability of AEC II to proliferate and differentiate into AEC I is an important factor leading to this disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. More and more evidence has shown that in addition to direct AEC II injury, other cell programmed cell death (PCD) including apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, pyroptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, autophagy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and ferroptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> plays an important role in the molecular and biological mechanism of BPD and the further development of the disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Studies have shown that alveolar epithelial cell deaths are associated with lung injury, affecting alveolar development and participates in the pathological process of BPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Therefore, it is essential to explore the potential pathogenesis of AEC II in BPD for the development and treatment of BPD.</p><p>At present, many studies have focused on the regulation of the immune microenvironment during lung development and disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The pathogenesis of BPD also includes changes in the proportion of immune cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. In recent years, studies have mainly focused on the role of immune cells and immune responses in the pathogenesis of BPD, but the mechanism and role of different immune cells in BPD still unclear. Several recent discoveries have been made regarding how a particular subset of Natural killer T (NKT) cells, invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, play a key role in chronic inflammation and fibrosis in lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and liver diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, iNKT cells activation is considered to be an important upstream event that promotes chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. iNKT cells are considered as a kind of innate T lymphocyte population, which are lymphocytes with the characteristics of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells, and serve as a bridge connecting the two immune responses, which can initiate or inhibit immune responses depending on the environment, account for the majority of NKT cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. iNKT cells are tissue-resident and play an important role in tissue homeostasis and immunity in lung tissues, they patrol the lumen of pulmonary vascular and interstitial tissue until lung tissue becomes infected and signals danger, causing iNKT cells migrate to damaged sites containing glycolipid antigens and inducing iNKT cells to initiate early host defense mechanisms, preferentially locating in lung parenchyma <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</p><p>The percentage of iNKT cells in lung tissue was higher than that of other lymphocytes in the lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Previous studies have shown that the number and function of iNKT cells are different in different lung diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Pulmonary iNKT cells are involved in the pathogenesis of various lung diseases, including direct pathogenic effects through their cytokine secretion, or more indirectly by regulating the function of neighboring immune cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In particular, cytokine production by iNKT cells has been implicated in many lung diseases, including allergic asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, pulmonary fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and others. iNKT cells are adaptive immune cells with innate functions that have been shown to play a role in the neonatal immune response, where they can be activated by proinflammatory cytokines or lipid antigens and trigger further cytokine production and activation by other immune cell populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. It has been shown that iNKT cells play an important role in the neonatal response to sepsis, and loss of iNKT cells leads to improved survival in neonatal septic mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. iNKT cells are involved in the deterioration of lung disease after respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in neonatal mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Therefore, it may be particularly valuable to further investigate the role of pulmonary iNKT cells in respiratory diseases, which may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic targets. However, the role of iNKT cells in BPD remains unclear.</p><p>IL-15 is a major cytokine responsible for NKT cells development, maturation, and survival <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In this study, we first downloaded microarray data from GEO database to analyze the peripheral blood IL-15 expression in BPD patients, and clinically examined peripheral blood NKT cells changes in BPD patients. Secondly, a mouse model of BPD was established by hyperoxia to investigate the effect of iNKT cells in lung tissue on lung differentiation. Finally, iNKT cells sorted by magnetic beads and AEC II-iNKT cells transwell co-culture system were established in vitro under hyperoxia. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on AEC II under different incubation conditions to investigate the possible mechanisms by which iNKT cells affect AEC II.</p></div>

We screened the GEO database for microarray sequencing analysis data that met the following criteria: (1) studies containing preterm infants of less than 32 weeks gestational age and birth weight ≤1500 g, (2) studies with blood samples that were from infants on the 5th to 14th day of life for the assessment of gene expression. Based on the above criteria, one data set (GSE32472) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> was obtained from the GEO database. A total of 111 preterm infants were included in this prospective study, conducted between September 1, 2008, and November 30, 2010. The GSE32472 of RNA sequencing in peripheral blood of BPD children was downloaded from NCBI GEO database (<ref type="url" target="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ref>).

All studies were performed in each experiment with 4-9 animals per group. Fixed tissue was cut into 5 μm thick sections and sections were used for hematoxylin-eosin (H&amp;E) staining morphometric analysis. To obtain a complete slide image, the slide was scanned. Lung volume measurements were performed by carefully drying the inflated and fixed lungs with soft tissue and assessed using the Archimedes principle <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. At least 5 slides were assessed under a light microscope at 100× magnification from per mouse of each specimen. Images were from 10 randomly selected parenchymal fields, and regions with large airways or blood vessels were excluded. The structural and morphological changes of the lung tissue were observed under a light microscope at 400× magnification.

The expression of IL-15 gradually increased with the progression of BPD (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). We first aimed to determine the percentage of NKT cells (CD45 + CD56 + CD3 + ) in peripheral blood (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B</ref>). Patients with BPD had an increased percentage of NKT cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref> and <ref type="figure">D</ref>) and the △MFI of the activation markers CD69 relative to isotype controls was analyzed on NKT cells (CD3 + CD56 + ) in BPD group and non-BPD group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>).

The body size changes of mice under normoxia and hyperoxia at P3, P7, P10, and P14 were evaluated and compared. The body size development of hyperoxia group was lagging behind that of mice grown in normoxia group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>, Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). Relative to the normoxia group, the number of immune cells in BALF increased in hyperoxia group at P14 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>). To evaluate the pathological changes in lung tissue by H&amp;E staining was used. Hyperoxia group mice had disordered alveolar structure with progressive thickening of alveolar walls, decreased number of alveoli, and simplified structure, lung volume decreased, RAC decreased, and MLI increased, (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2C-E</ref>). To assess lung development, we used PAS staining to detect glycogen in lung epithelial cells.We used tissue immunofluorescence and WB for the SP-C (AEC II-specific marker) and T1α (AEC I-specific marker). In the present study, pulmonary epithelial glycogen content was measured by PAS staining, the epithelial content of glycogen reflects the development and maturation of the lung <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, and it was found that hyperoxia group mice had increased glycogen content compared with normoxia group mice at P14 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F</ref>).

Treatment of mice in the hyperoxia group with anti-CD1d significantly reduced cell numbers in the BALF compared with the use of anti-IgG controls (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). Hyperoxia group mice were intraperitoneally injected with anti-CD1d antibody to inhibit iNKT cells activation and abundance, the alveolar structure tends to be regular, the number of alveoli increases, and the alveolar walls become thinner, RAC increased and MLI decreased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B-C</ref>). The glycogen content of the contrast lung epithelium was evaluated and decreased after administration of anti-CD1d in hyperoxia group by PAS staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B-C</ref>).

Repeated intranasal administration of α-GalCer to mice showed no abnormal appearance or behavior. α-GalCer significantly increased the number of iNKT cells detected by flow cytometry and the gene expression marker Vα14Jα18 in the lung (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C-D</ref>). As shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B</ref>, observed in hyperoxia group mice with repeated administration of α-GalCer, H&amp;E showed enlarged alveoli and marked cellular infiltrates in the lungs of mice given repeated α-GalCer, which were not found in the lungs of treated control IgG. The degree of impairment in lung parameters was increased compared with hyperoxia group mice, specifically, RAC decreased and MLI increased (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B-C</ref>). The proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-17A were increased in the lungs of mice treated with α-GalCer compared with mice treated with control (Supplementary Figs. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E-F</ref>). The epithelial content of contrast glycogen was evaluated, and glycogen staining increased after α-GalCer administration compared with hyperoxia group mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5B-C</ref>). To further verify the effect of the number and activation of iNKT cells on BPD mice, iNKT cells in the lungs of mice were sorted by magnetic beads, and their purity was identified by flow cytometry, its purity was more than 95 % (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1G</ref>). After adoptive transfer of iNKT cells via tail vein, they were placed in the normoxia and hyperoxia environment respectively. DiR-labeled iNKT cells were detected by in vivo small animal imaging at the time of adoptive transfusion, 30 min, 12 h and 24 h. The iNKT cells were mainly concentrated in the liver and lung. Compared with the normoxia group, the hyperoxia group had stronger fluorescence intensity of DiR stained iNKT cells in vivo, and significantly increased fluorescence intensity in liver and lung, suggesting that hyperoxia could induce recruitment of iNKT cells in lung (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5D</ref>). At the same time, after adoptive transfer of iNKT cells to the hyperoxia group at P10, showed disordered alveolar structure, larger alveolar fusion, reduced number, simplified structure, thickened alveolar wall, and increased inflammatory cells compared with the control group at P14 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5G-H</ref>). WB results showed that SP-C and T1α protein expression in the lung tissue of the hyperoxia group was decreased, and SP-C and T1α protein expression was significantly decreased in hyperoxia group mice adoptive transfer with iNKT cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5F</ref>). The results of immunofluorescence double staining showed that the expression of SP-C and T1α in the lung tissue of hyperoxia group mice adoptive transfer with iNKT cells detected at P14 was decreased, and T1α + SP-C + cells (% total SP-C + cells) were decreased compared with hyperoxia group mice (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5E</ref>).

The cells were round in shape, consistent with the characteristics of lymphocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6A</ref>). AEC II was cultured alone or with iNKT cells sorted by magnetic beads and exposed to normoxia and hyperoxia for 72 h, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6B</ref>). WB was used to detect the expression of SP-C and T1α in AEC II, after 72 h of exposure in compared with the normoxia group, the expression of SP-C in AEC II in hyperoxia group was significantly decreased, the expression level of T1α was increased. The expression of SP-C and T1α in AEC II + iNKT group was lower than the AEC II group under hyperoxia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6C</ref>). Therefore, we performed immunofluorescence staining showed that the expression of SP-C was dominant in AEC II in normoxia group. However, the expression of SP-C was extremely low in hyperoxia group. SP-C and T1α were reduced, and colocalization was reduced in the AEC II + iNKT group compared with AEC II alone under hyperoxia (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6D</ref>).

In addition, WB showed a significant decrease in GPX4 and FTH1 levels and an increase in PTGS2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7D</ref>). Lipid peroxidation was significantly increased as detected by C11 bodipy staining (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7E</ref>).

In our study, a classic neonatal mice model of BPD exposed to hyperoxia was used, H&amp;E results showed that compared with the normoxia group, the hyperoxia group had simplified alveolar structure, reduced alveolar number, dilated alveolar space, and significantly thickened alveolar wall, this indicates that we have successfully established a mice model of BPD. At present, it is believed that AEC II injury is the key to lung epithelial injury and is the pathological basis of BPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>. AEC II is the main stem cell in the lung, which can differentiate into AEC I to maintain lung homeostasis. In the recent study, AEC II was labeled with SP-C and E-cadherin, and differentiation of AEC II was evaluated by qRT-PCR and immunostaining/western blot <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. SP-C is a highly specific AEC II cell marker. T1α is AEC I cell marker. Differentiated AEC II and AEC I cells differ phenotypically and express different cell-specific marker. SP-C + /T1α + cells refer to the co-expression situation of these two markers, suggesting that these cells may be in a transformed or partially differentiated state. Certainly, the expression of SP-C + /T1α + may also be heterogeneous during the differentiation of AEC II into AEC I, this was also initially confirmed in previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>, however, SP-C + /T1α + double labeling of AEC II can be used to determine the differentiation of AEC II into AEC I. We found that the proportion of SP-C and T1α double-stained cells was significantly lower in the hyperoxia group compared with the normoxia group, and a decrease in SP-C expression without a corresponding increase in T1α expression under hyperoxia by WB analysis of lung tissue. Glycogen is an important substance that reflects the maturity of ACE II <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>. With cell differentiation, glycogen is consumed and converted into alveolar surfactant phospholipids, so PAS staining can be used to assess pulmonary differentiation, we also found glycogen content was increased in the hyperoxia group compared with the normoxia group of littermates, these results suggested that hyperoxia reduced SP-C and T1α, and may related to abnormal AEC II differentiation.</p><p>Recent studies have found that changes of iNKT cells in the number and function play an important role in lung diseases. Under normal physiological conditions, iNKT cells are most abundant in the liver, spleen and lung, when in inflammation or infection, such as in pulmonary asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>, acute hyperoxic lung injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, LPS-induced acute lung injury <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, COPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, ARDS <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and sterile inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, iNKT cells can be significantly increased and activated in the lung to a certain extent, which is pathogenic. At present, the role of NKT in BPD is not clear. IL-15 is a developmental factor of NKT cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. Microarray data analysis shows that BPD patients have a significant increase in IL-15, but it is not clear whether NKT cells activated and increased in BPD. Firstly, we examined the NKT cells in the peripheral blood of patients with BPD and found that NKT cells increased and activated in peripheral blood of patients with BPD, suggest that NKT cells may play a role in the development of BPD, but further studies are needed. So, we used hyperoxia to replicate the BPD model, and found that compared with the normoxia group, the percentage of iNKT cells in lung tissue was increased, and the CD69 representing their activation status was significantly increased, suggesting that NKT cells may be involved in the pathophysiological process of BPD. Studies suggested that iNKT cells activation is a key upstream event that promotes chronic inflammation and fibrosis, and it is involved in the type 1, type 2, and type 3 cytokine pathways to promote fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. iNKT cells activation has also been shown to play a key role in promoting Wnt signaling and promoting the transition of epithelial cells to myofibroblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. To further investigate whether the increase and activation of iNKT cells is associated with impaired lung differentiation in BPD, we used anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody interfering with iNKT cells activation status in BPD mice, the number of immune cells in BALF significantly reduced, H&amp;E staining showed that as the activation status and abundance of iNKT cells decreased, the alveolar structure tended to be regular, the number of alveoli increased and alveoli cavity was more uniform, RAC increased and MLI decreased, PAS showed a decrease in glycogen, WB and tissue immunofluorescence showed that SP-C, T1α increased, and fluorescence localization showed that SP-C and T1α co-localization increased, these results suggested that the abnormal development in BPD mice was alleviated after using anti-CD1d neutralizing antibody. It has been shown that treatment with anti-human CD1d antibody in a primate inflammation model, significantly reduces the number of macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and basophils in BALF. Previous studies have found that partial inhibition of iNKT cells activation by anti-CD1d antibody can reduce the release of cytokines in septic mice, thereby reducing the damage of organ function and ultimately reducing the mortality of septic mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>. Treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury model mice with anti-CD1d antibody alleviated lung dysfunction and inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, important features of COPD, such as inflammation and emphysema, were significantly suppressed in CD1d -/-lacking iNKT cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, CD1d deficiency has a protective effect on FA-induced renal fibrosis in mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>. The above studies suggest that blocking iNKT cell activation reduces alveolarization disorders in BPD and may be related to promoting lung differentiation.</p><p>To further investigate whether iNKT cells activation exacerbates lung development disorder in BPD, in this study, we used nasal instillation of α-Galcer, a specific activator of iNKT cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, in addition to extract iNKT cells by magnetic beads and adoptive transfer into mice via the tail vein. We found that BPD mice treated with α-GalCer showed more  disordered alveolar structure, larger alveolar fusion, reduced number, simplified structure, thickened alveolar wall, and increased inflammatory cells by H&amp;E. PAS staining showed increased glycogen accumulation. We successfully sorted iNKT cells with a purity greater than 95 %, and after adoptive transfer into BPD mice, iNKT cells reached the lungs after 30 min of in vivo imaging observation. In a similar study to adoptive transfer, iNKT cells were found to first reach the lungs within 15 min <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>. Next, after successful adoptive transfer of iNKT cells, mice were exposed to hyperoxia for 4 days, and lung tissues were collected at P14. We found recruitment of iNKT cells in the lungs of the hyperoxia group, accompanied by an increase in glycogen by PAS staining, decreased expression of SP-C and T1α by WB and decreased co-localization of SP-C and T1α by immunofluorescence, these results showed that the lung disorder of BPD mice was aggravated after adoptive transfer iNKT cells. It has been suggested that repeated use of αGalCer to activate pulmonary iNKT cells can cause COPD-like symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, after adoptive transfer of iNKT cells in a mouse model of ischemia-reperfusion injury, the lung injury score was increased by H&amp;E <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. The above studies suggest that iNKT cells activation and recruitment can aggravate lung injury, but whether it affects AEC II differentiation needs to be further studied.</p><p>AEC II is the main stem cell in the lung, which can differentiate into AEC I <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. In BPD, AEC II plays a central role in lung development arrest and injury repair. In our study, after 72 h of hyperoxia exposure, the expression of SP-C decreased, and T1α increased. The expression of T1α is different in vivo and in vitro under hyperoxia, which may be related to the following reasons: firstly, environment is not the same in vivo and in vitro, in vivo, cells are affected by many factors, including signal transduction between cells, immune response, etc., while in vitro culture, the cell environment is relatively simplified, may lead to different response patterns; secondly, the length of hyperoxia exposure is also different, 72 h of hyperoxia exposure is an acute lung injury, T1α compensatory increase. 14 days of hyperoxia exposure is a chronic lung injury, T1α decompensatory decrease, this is consistent with the results of Cao YX et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> and Hou A et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>; thirdly, Yee M et al., found that the increased T1α under hyperoxia is not differentiated from the labeled AEC II by special labeling of AEC II <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>. In future studies, tracing techniques for AEC II can be combined to better understand the functional changes of AEC II. To further clarify the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II, we verified it at the cellular level. We constructed AEC II-iNKT cells co-culture system by transwell technology and under hyperoxia exposure. Immunofluorescence and WB results showed that SP-C decreased in the group of AEC II alone under hyperoxia, and the decrease of SP-C and T1α in the co-culture group of AEC II-iNKT cells was more significant under hyperoxia. Fluorescence localization showed that the co-localization of SP-C and T1α in AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured under hyperoxia was decreased, suggesting that iNKT cells aggravated abnormal AEC II under hyperoxia.</p><p>Next, to explore the possible mechanisms underlying the effect of iNKT cells on AEC II, we performed RNA sequencing of AEC II in different groups, DEGs with PCD in the GO database related genes are compared, we found that among all PCD related differential genes, the number of DEGs related to ferroptosis was the highest. Ferroptosis is a form of PCD that is induced by lipid peroxidation and is iron-dependent <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>, which plays an important role in the molecular and biological mechanism of BPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Previous studies have shown that hyperoxia induces ferroptosis and impairs lung development in neonatal mice, and features of ferroptosis are detected in mouse lung tissues and in vitro cell models under hyperoxia conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>. Ferroptosis induces alveolar type II cell damage <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in alveolar epithelial cells and promotes the process of fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61]</ref>. Recent studies also found that ferroptosis in AEC II causes pathological damage under hyperoxia and other stimuli. Additionally, ferroptosis is considered immune-regulated, and immune-derived cell death <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>. Gpx4 is the main core enzyme regulating the glutathione antioxidant system, and its reduction is an important marker for the occurrence of ferroptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>. Our current study shows ferroptosis was changed both in AEC II cultured alone under hyperoxia and AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured under hyperoxia, but more pronounced in AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured group under hyperoxia, these changes included increased Fe 2+ , Lipid peroxidation, and MDA levels, as well as elevated expression of genes PTGS2, reduced expression of GPX4 and FTH1, and ferroptosis characteristics were more obvious in AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured group by transmission electron microscopy. However, whether iNKT cells recruitment and activation aggravates AEC II abnormal differentiation by ferroptosis need further study. To further demonstrate that iNKT cells aggravate AEC II damage by inducing ferroptosis under hyperoxia, ferroptosis activator Erastin and ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1 were used. We found that T1α and SP-C were decreased when Erastin were added in iNKT + AEC II group, after add ferroptosis inhibitor Fer-1, showed that T1α and SP-C were increased, these suggested that AEC II ferroptosis accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. Previous studies have found that hyperoxia promotes AEC II ferroptosis, and increases the transdifferentiation of type II epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. Ferroptosis inhibitors liproxstatin -1 (Lip) and deferoxamine (DFO) alleviated the symptoms of pulmonary fibrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. These studies suggested that increased ferroptosis realates to differentation of AEC II. Our study mainly showed that iNKT cells aggravated the ferroptosis of AEC II under hyperoxia, but the specific mechanism still needs to be further studied. Previous studies have shown that IL-17A promotes airway epithelial ferroptosis in asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, and it has been reported that IL-17A can cooperate with IL-6 to promote ferroptosis of alveolar epithelial cells under acute hyperoxia <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>. Previous study found that the pro-inflammatory effect of iNKT cells was mainly through the secretion of IL-17A and IL-6. Co-culture of AEC II and iNKT cells increased IL-17A levels than only AEC II cultured alone. Some studies reported the IL -6 in the expression and significance of BPD environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>. After specifically activating iNKT cells, we found that inflammatory factor IL-6 and IL-17A were increased in vivo, IL-17A and IL-6 were also increased in the supernatant of AEC II-iNKT cells co-cultured in vitro under hyperoxia. Therefore, we speculate that iNKT cells may also promote ferroptosis in AEC II by secreting IL-17A together with IL-6 present in the inflammatory environment. However, we have only initially explored the mechanism by which iNKT cells affect abnormal AEC II expression under hyperoxia. For this is just our speculation and some preliminary experimental verification, the follow-up still need further study.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are still some limitations in this study. Our current study only found that iNKT cells affected the expression of AEC II and AEC I after hyperoxia, there is no direct evidence to support an association between the abundance and activation iNKT cells with impaired differentiation of AEC II into AEC I. Our study only used single gene to represent AEC II or AEC I to investigate the differentiation, we only use SP-C and T1α as the gene marker, if use multiple gene markers may be more rigorous. In future experiments, we will also employ lineage label to more clearly observe AEC II differentiation status in different pathological environments. Certainly, the most specific tool for iNKT cells in mice and humans are αGalCer/CD1d tetramers, it may be more specific if αGalCer/CD1d tetramers are employed. In addition, the main pathological manifestations of BPD are alveolarization disorder and abnormal pulmonary microvascular development, the interaction between NKT cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells under hyperoxia has not been explored. Studies have found that peripheral blood NKT cells are increased and activated, and inhibit the proliferation and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), thereby inducing vascular injuries in diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref>. S K et al. found that NKT cells induced by IL-4 leads to pulmonary artery wall thickening <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. These studies suggested that abnormal activation of NKT cells may also affect microvascular endothelial cells, however, further studies are needed to determine whether NKT cells affects pulmonary microvascular development in BPD.</p><p>Studies showed that iNKT cells accumulate mainly in microvasculature after moving from the thymus into circulation, and there is substantial evidence that iNKT cells migration into the lung tissue rapidly under various activation conditions, such as when the lung is stimulated by airborne antigens or infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Based on the above and our experimental results, can only presume hyperoxia lead to an increased recruitment or local expansion of activated iNKT cells in the lungs, which cannot be accurately determined as recruitment or tissue resident. In addition, CD69 in iNKT cells was detected to be elevated, and it is also one of the markers of early activation and tissue resident lymphocytes, however, an increase in CD69 alone does not represent tissue resident cells, may need to be confirmed by parabiosis experiments <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, so, we still need more in-depth research, and these will be further studied in the future.</p><p>Our study found that hyperoxia leads to the recruitment and activation of iNKT cells in the lungs. Over-activated iNKT cells induces ferroptosis in AEC II, accompanied by decreased expression of SP-C and T1α. AEC II dysfunction leads to the obstruction of alveolarization and occurrence of BPD.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
