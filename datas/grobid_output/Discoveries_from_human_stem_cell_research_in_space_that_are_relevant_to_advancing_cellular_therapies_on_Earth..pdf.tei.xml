<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Over the last two decades, there have been tremendous advancements in stem cell biology within regenerative medicine as well as innovations in space technologies. The International Space Station (ISS) has been increasingly supportive of academic and commercial groups using microgravity for research and product development with potential benefits for use on Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> . There is a growing interest in evaluating the potential for stem cells and their derived tissues in space to model human disease mechanisms and treat diseases through cell therapy.</p><p>At the start of human spaceflight, the primary focus of life science research conducted in space was to understand the physiological effects of the spaceflight environment including microgravity on humans to keep them alive and well in this extreme environment. Additionally, medical research in space has uncovered valuable evidence about the effects of microgravity on the human condition including biological processes and disease pathways. A great wealth of knowledge about cells and tissues has been known in biomedical space research. In recent years, there has been an emerging interest from scientists, governments, and commercial entities to investigate human health in space for the benefit of humans on Earth too. Studying stem cells in space has uncovered their behavior in an environment other than Earth, revealing mechanisms which would otherwise be undetected or unknown with the inevitable presence of normal gravity. This includes changes to stem cell proliferation rates, differentiation, and lineage phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> . Stem cell research performed in space has shown potential ways microgravity can be leveraged to advance cellular therapeutics in space to benefit human life and commercial enterprise on Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . This paper reviews important discoveries that have occurred in real microgravity conditions on the ISS demonstrating the impact of microgravity on fundamental stem cell properties relevant to regenerative medicine practices and therapeutics on Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> . We present here different areas of stem cell research conducted in space that have potential to translate to terrestrial applications within the context of developing cellular therapies while also highlighting the limitations and opposing evidence available. Prior to these spaceflight studies, little was known about the role of microgravity in influencing human stem cell growth and fate. We are just starting to understand the ways in which a microgravity environment influences stem cell function, division, and survival.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Stem cell studies in space and their potential application</head><p>The main types of stem cells used in clinical and experimental cell therapy are pluripotent stem cells and adult stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells include embryonic stem cells, epiblast stem cells, embryonic germ cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs are specialized human stem cells created in the lab from a person's blood or skin cells and can generate nearly any cell in the body, and hence, can be used in regenerative medicine therapies. They are derived from direct reprogramming of postnatal/adult somatic cells in vitro. They also carry an individual's own DNA making them ideal for creating tailored treatments for diseases and are essential in the field of personalized medicine. Currently, the clinical use of pluripotent stem cells largely lacks therapeutic evidence and is constrained to investigational regenerative medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> . As for adult stem cells, they are rare, undifferentiated stem cells which replenish cells and contribute to growth and repair of tissue by giving rise to progenitor cells which differentiate into the required cell types. Adult stem cells include hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), skin stem cells (SSCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> . With current tissue engineering technologies and advancements in gene editing techniques, stem cells can be remodeled into three-dimensional organoids and tissue structures, further exacerbating their use in personalized regenerative applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</p><p>Stem cell-based therapies are a possible treatment for age-related conditions including stroke, dementia, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer, among other conditions and injuries. However, such treatments may require large amounts of stem cells, and this is difficult to achieve since expanding stem cells for therapies remains a challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> . One of the most important factors influencing therapeutic effects of stem cells is their culture environment, including presence or absence of gravitational forces. Microgravity is recognized as a novel culture environment for stem cells as a result of the unique changes which can occur in a microgravity culture <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</p><p>Different research groups around the world have been working on expanding stem cells in space for use in terrestrial studies and practices. This is a result of the advantages that the microgravity environment provides to cells in space. The goal of almost all these spaceflight studies is to enhance growth of large amounts of safe and high-quality clinical-grade stem cells with minimal cell differentiation. The studies also evaluate the feasibility of successful harvest and transport of the space expanded stem cells back to Earth. Optimizing these experiments and creating standardized protocols can enable the growth of stem cells in space for patient use on Earth.</p><p>The space environment offers an advantage to the growth of stem cells by providing a more natural three-dimensional (3D) state for their expansion which closely resembles growth of cells in the human body, in comparison to the two-dimensional (2D) culture environment available on Earth which less likely imitates real tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> . A 3D cell culture system better mimics the behaviors and reactions of cells in vivo than 2D systems by simulating native cell-cell interactions and development. Therefore, scientists are interested in the effects of microgravity in creating a 3D cell culture system for stem cells by offloading the gravitational forces exerted on cells and replicating physiological composition of cells and their spatial arrangements <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> . Different types of stem cells have been sent into space to assess whether space is in fact an ideal platform to produce large quantities of stem cells and eventually improve treatments on Earth.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Types of stem cells studied in space</head><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs), cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) have been sent to the ISS and returned for analysis. Their phenotypic and functional characteristics including their biology, stemness, and fate choice towards specific lineages were evaluated to ensure their maintenance of identity and safety (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). These stem cells are vital for stem cell therapy including bone marrow transplant for the treatment of bone or blood cancers, and helping patients recover neurons and blood vessels after a stroke. Successfully growing stem cells in space and maintaining their stemness without differentiation into other downstream lineages while bringing them back to Earth in good condition can make these cells feasible for use in patients in the future (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Mesenchymal stem cells</head><p>MSCs are known to have potential as therapeutic agents. However, their safe and efficient expansion while maintaining stem cell properties is still a major challenge in the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> . Nonetheless, a study conducted by Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> evaluated the feasibility, potency, and safety of growing human bone marrow derived MSCs in space for potential future clinical applications. The MSCs were grown on the ISS for two weeks and different analyses were performed on them after their return to Earth. The results of this study showed that MSCs maintained their phenotype and proliferative characteristics after expansion on the ISS, prior microgravity exposure did not influence MSC differentiation abilities, and several cytokines and growth factors were significantly altered by microgravity and dependent on duration of exposure. MSCs grown in space showed enhanced immunosuppressive capabilities compared to those cultured on Earth. Also, no evidence of malignant transformation or genomic integrity compromise were found as demonstrated via the chromosomal, DNA damage and tumorigenicity assays <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> . Furthermore, it is hypothesized that MSC cultures maintained in microgravity may be used for cell-based therapy in diseases of the central nervous system. Results collected via gene expression profiling from the experiment "Stroma-2" performed aboard the ISS showed that in-space mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs had higher expression of genes involved in neural development, neuron morphogenesis, and transmission of nerve impulse and synapse than MSCs grown on Earth <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> . Also, human MSCs cultured in simulated microgravity demonstrated therapeutic properties in a mouse model of acute injury via significantly higher expression of antiinflammatory and anti-apoptotic factors compared to MSCs cultured in normal gravity <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> . Brain-injured mice that were transplanted with MSCs cultured in microgravity showed greater motor functional recovery than those transplanted with MSCs cultured in normal gravity <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> . Similarly, rat bone marrow-derived MSCs cultured in simulated microgravity which were transplanted into a rat model of spinal cord injury showed enhanced functional improvement and therapeutic effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> . Although the detailed mechanisms remain unclear, the results of these various stem cell transplantation studies demonstrate the benefits of using simulated microgravity as part of the culture experimental design to enhance therapeutic effects of MSCs using cell-based therapy for central nervous system diseases.</p><p>Nonetheless, simulated microgravity has been shown to inhibit the migration of rat MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> and suppress the differentiation of human MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> , mouse MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> , and rat MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> . Suppression of differentiation under microgravity may alter generation of multiple tissue lineages in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . However, inhibition of differentiation of MSCs preserves their stemness and allows them to maintain their stem cell identity. This could help expand the cells in space for clinical application on Earth. Furthermore, simulated microgravity has been seen to inhibit proliferation of MSCs in some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31</ref> and show increased proliferation compared to those cultured in normal gravity in others <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> . Therefore, conflicting data is present on the behavior of MSCs in microgravity, and hence, their potential benefits in stem cell-based therapy needs to be further explored.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hematopoietic stem cells</head><p>HSCs are primarily found in the bone marrow and give rise to all mature blood cells including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33</ref> . The effects of spaceflight on human HSC proliferation and differentiation were explored in vitro via culture of CD34+ bone marrow-derived cells in suspension for 11 days during the space shuttle mission STS-63 (Discovery) and 13 days during STS-69 (Endeavour). Compared to ground control samples, the in-space HSCs exhibited a significant decline in the growth of myeloid and erythroid progenitor cell numbers. The in-space HSCs also showed an absolute increase in terminally differentiated macrophages, suggesting accelerated differentiation towards the macrophage lineage. The study indicates that the proliferation and differentiation of HSCs is impacted by microgravity with erythropoiesis being particularly sensitive to changes in gravity. Therefore, gravity may play a key role in certain pathways and biological processes of in vitro hematopoiesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> . Additionally, these findings suggest that spaceflight anemia may be a result of suppression of erythropoiesis by microgravity, among other factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35</ref> . The reduced differentiation observed within in-space HSCs suggests that microgravity may play a role in preserving the stemness of HSCs, and hence, may be used as HSC therapy in which they can be given to patients to produce functional and terminally differentiated cells. It remains to be established that space expanded HSC can produce functional and terminally differentiated hematopoietic cells on Earth.</p><p>On the contrary, a significant decrease in the number of mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells was reported during 12 days of spaceflight and simulated microgravity, mainly by blocking cell cycle at G1/S transition. However, their differentiation abilities were not affected <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36</ref> . In addition to this, a study which analyzed peripheral blood samples from six astronauts who had participated in spaceflight missions found significant changes in several cell populations at different time points, • MSCs maintained their proliferative capabilities.</p><p>• Down-regulation in expression of PLK1, suggesting µG may slow progression of MSCs at later stages of the cell cycle during longerterm culture.</p><p>• MSCs maintained their differentiation capacity.</p><p>• MSCs exhibited enhanced immunosuppressive capacity.</p><p>• No evidence of tumorigenic transformation.</p><p>• It is feasible to grow MSC in space for human application on Earth.</p><p>• MSCs expanded on the ISS could be clinically used to treat inflammatory conditions.</p><p>Huang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs)</p><p>11 days (STS-63) and 13 days (STS-69) • CD34+ cells maintained cell viability &gt;95%.</p><p>• Significant decrease in growth potential of multilineage, particularly erythroid, hematopoietic progenitor cells.</p><p>• The decrease in progenitor cell pool is coupled to an increase in terminally differentiated macrophages. • CD34+ cells can be expanded in space, given the right culture conditions.</p><p>• µG may have direct effects on in vivo hematopoiesis during early primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation and may be a significant component of the clinical syndrome of spaceflight anemia.</p></div>

The changes to lineage cells and HSCs were further studied in a mouse model, using hindlimb unloading to simulate microgravity, and found a reduction in frequency of NK cells, B cells, and erythrocyte precursors in the bone marrow and increase in frequency of T cells, neutrophils, and HSCs. Deep sequencing showed changes in the expression of regulatory molecules important for the differentiation of HSCs, and hence, their findings demonstrated that spaceflight and simulated microgravity may disrupt the homeostasis of immune system and cause dynamic changes to both HSCs and lineage cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> . Additionally, simulated microgravity was shown to significantly inhibit the migration potential, cell-cycle progression and differentiation patterns in primitive HSC <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> and impair DNA damage repair in human HSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> . Profound changes to HSCs may limit their applications in stem cell-based therapies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells</head><p>The heart has limited ability in regenerating lost cardiomyocytes following an adverse event like a heart attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41</ref> . However, cardiomyocytes derived from human iPSCs may be a potential solution to replacing lost and dead cells in such an event. Wnorowski et al. 2019 analyzed human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) following 5.5 weeks of culture in space on the ISS. Analysis of gene expression, structure, and functions of these cells in comparison with ground control hiPSC-CMs was done. The differences observed include changes in calcium handling while RNA-sequencing showed differential expression of 2635 genes among flight, post-flight, and ground control samples, specifically upregulated genes involved in mitochondrial metabolism. No significant differences in cell morphology or sarcomere structure between spaceflight and ground control samples were seen. This study demonstrated the use of hiPSC-CMs to model the effects of microgravity in space, showing that the cells change their functional properties in spaceflight and compensate for the reduction in gravity by altering their gene expression patterns at the cellular level. Also, this study demonstrated the successful culture and return of viable cardiomyocytes derived from iPSCs which may pose potential therapeutic use <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> .</p><p>Additionally, another study investigated hiPSC-CMs in space, starting with hiPSC-cardiac progenitors. Cryopreserved 3D hiPSC-cardiac progenitors differentiated into cardiomyocytes and showed 3-fold larger sphere sizes, 20-fold higher counts of nuclei, and increased expression of proliferation markers compared to ground control samples, following three weeks on the ISS. In-space hiPSC-CMs also demonstrated increased expression of contraction-associated genes and enhanced calcium handling. Transient exposure to microgravity (3 days) showed upregulation in genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival, and contraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> . Therefore, the successful expansion of hiPSC-CMs derived from hiPSCcardiac progenitors in space resulted in efficient production of highly enriched cardiomyocytes with the required features for function, and thus, may present potential therapeutic applications. These findings are supported by another study in which cardiac spheres derived from hiPSCs in simulated microgravity culture showed enhanced production of highly enriched cardiomyocytes (99% purity) with high viability (90%), upregulation of genes associated with proliferation and survival and expected functional properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> . During iPSC generation, the gravity-induced tension present on Earth is absent under microgravity conditions, possibly making it easier for stem cells to multiply quicker.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cardiovascular progenitor cells</head><p>Cardiac regeneration is limited due to insufficient numbers of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs), low self-renewal potency and production of immature cardiomyocytes, among other reasons <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref> .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Neural stem cells</head><p>Neural stem cells (NSCs) derived from human iPSCs were cultured on the ISS and then returned to Earth. Analysis of these cells showed that they preserved their stemness and were able to proliferate in space while also remaining as NSCs after 39.3 days unattended in the same culture medium in space. These in-space NSCs were able to maintain their ability to become young neurons when cultured in neuronal specification media (NSM) upon return, indicating that exposure to microgravity in space did not change their potential to choose the neuronal fate. Additionally, neuroblasts proliferated for over a week when placed in NSM before deciding to mature <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> .</p><p>These findings show that microgravity is an excellent tool to increase neural cell numbers without the need to perform genetic manipulations of long-term treatments with mitogens. This is relevant to advancing human health on Earth since neurodegenerative diseases frequently result from loss of a specific cell population and perhaps in-space grown NSCs can be a potential solution. Investigating the effects of microgravity in space on the regulation of NSCs and their commitment to a specific lineage can offer benefits to patients on Earth for cell replacement therapies and recovery of CNS structure and function. This can be done by using donor cells from the patients themselves to address neurodegenerative and development disorders including cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis, and then developing personalized treatments for them.</p><p>In addition to this, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) based transcriptomic profiling revealed that NSCs maintained greater stemness ability during spaceflight via elevation of markers for stemness including Sox2, Pax6, and Notch1 despite reduction in growth rate. Also, the increased expression of mature neuron marker Map2 and decrease in astrocyte marker Gfap and the oligodendrocyte markers Gal and Olig2 demonstrated NSCs' tendency to differentiate into neurons in space. These findings suggest that culture in outer space combined with biomaterial-based 3D culture system may improve the neural differentiation abilities of NSCs in vitro and contribute to tissue engineering. Further understanding of the mechanisms which occur in NSCs during spaceflight could improve our knowledge and unveil potential benefits for NSC-based regenerative medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> . Also, boundary cap neural crest stem cells exposed to real microgravity in space showed improved viability and increased survival and proliferation compared to cells exposed to simulated gravity on Earth, with significantly different gene expression patterns for proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation between the space and simulated microgravity groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> . Conflicting evidence persists since in-space NSCs experience a reduction in growth rate in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref> but also proliferate at a higher rate and up to 72 h following spaceflight, irrespective of flight duration <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55</ref> .</p><p>Furthermore, a recent study which assessed the behavior of in-space NSCs that readapted to Earth's gravity found that although most of these cells survived spaceflight and self-renewed, some showed enhanced stress responses and autophagy-like behavior via secretome and proteomics analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> and increased energy production demands <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> . Also, NSCs derived from hiPSCs which remained onboard the ISS for 39.6 days before returning to Earth showed an increased number of abnormal cell division events between one-and two-weeks post-space flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">58</ref> . Nonetheless, the different cell types that form the central nervous system, either individually or collectively, may respond to microgravity in different ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> . Also, the culture hardware used in space may play a role in how cells respond.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Further benefits</head><p>In addition to using in-space stem cells for clinical use on Earth, there are many other benefits that result from this scientific endeavor. Stem cells in space can be used as tools for scientists in disease modelling to test new therapeutics when studying a specific disease. Performing such experiments expands the use of space as a unique and natural environment in biomedical research to study biological phenomena to manipulate cell processes. Also, advancing in-space expansion of stem cells opens the door to exploring many other cell types and potential therapeutics to be evaluated and tested in microgravity, besides stem cells. Such research also encourages the study of organoids in space which may hold promising regenerative medicine and translational stem cell applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref> .</p><p>Additionally, the potential privatization and/or commercialization of in-space stem cells allows the acceleration of research and technology development in low Earth orbit (LEO), further expanding the medical commerce in space and valuable biomanufacturing enterprises. The advancements currently taking place in space infrastructure technologies are promising in reducing costs and increasing frequency to access space <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . Growing stem cells in space pushes the boundaries of creativity and innovation in seeking ways to help patients and advancing medical practice forward, that may not be replicated in a terrestrial setting. Using the LEO environment to expand stem cells and other products for scientific research and clinical use could provide insights that have significant impacts to the greater scientific community and public.</p><p>Furthermore, understanding how stem cells behave in space and their subsequent expansion helps the development of suitable countermeasures to protect astronauts from problems encountered during long-duration spaceflight missions. It benefits current and future space travelers as more knowledge is known about the effects of microgravity on the behavior of stem cells. An interdisciplinary approach including experts from a range of disciplines is required to achieve the full benefits of utilizing space to expand stem cells and stem cell-derived tissues for the benefit of mankind.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Current limitations and gaps</head><p>Despite the potential benefits to using stem cells grown in space for clinical use, there remain limitations and gaps in our knowledge, scientific practices, and funding capabilities to make this a reality for patients. Studying stem cells in space and investigating their safety and feasibility for use in cellular therapies is still in its infancy. A full understanding of the effects of microgravity on stem cell growth and differentiation is needed. It is yet to be established whether microgravity induces expansion (quantity) or potency/ stemness (quality) or both and whether the effect is universal to all types of stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> . There is conflicting evidence in the literature about the regenerative potential of various types of stem cells, as benefits associated with culturing stem cells in microgravity are reported for mesenchymal stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> hematopoietic stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> , cardiomyocytes derived from hiPSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">61</ref> , cardiovascular progenitor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> and neural stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> and disadvantages for mesenchymal stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> , hematopoietic stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref> and neural stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref> . Additionally, it has been reported that microgravity reduces regenerative potential of other stem cells including embryonic stem cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> . While simulated microgravity is seen to inhibit osteogenesis of MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> , it is also seen to increase adipogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62</ref> . There is limited understanding of how microgravity in space affects stem cell differentiation since on Earth this is a major barrier to expanding large quantities of stem cells. Also, optimal cell culture media for the in vitro expansion of stem cells while maintaining stemness and limiting differentiation is not well-established <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60</ref> . Further research is required to understand the stem cell-specific changes which occur in space to different types of stem cells, how to leverage and target those benefits while minimizing the disadvantages, and potential implications for regenerative therapeutics.</p><p>Additionally, different stem cell samples from different donors and sources need to be tested. The variability which exists in stem cell potency between different cell lines and the inability to maintain potency and genetic integrity with cell proliferation is still a challenge <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . Also, it is important to note that on Earth and especially with ageing, stem cell exhaustion occurs. This is known as the decrease in stem cell abundance and activity where they stop dividing after a couple of population doublings <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">63</ref> . Whether stem cell exhaustion happens in space needs to be studied, especially since the spaceflight microgravity environment induces an accelerated ageing phenotype in many in vivo physiological systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref> . Furthermore, microgravity is not the only major environmental change that stem cells are exposed to in space. Ionizing radiation (IR) in space affects stem cells, particularly when they are dividing, and this can transform cells to be malignant. Research has shown that stem cells exposed to simulated cosmic galactic cosmic ray (GCR) radiation or solar energetic particles (SEP) experience dramatic changes in their differentiation potential and report increased apoptosis, delayed DNA repair, DNA damage and mutations which may lead to leukemic transformation within the hematopoietic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> . Although IR exposure is associated with an increase in cancer risk, particularly leukemias, the exact mechanisms underlying IRinduced malignancy remain poorly understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref> . The effects of IR on tissues are complex and the causation of oncogenic mutations is not the only mechanism to explain the relationship between IR and cancers, among other factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">73</ref> . Evidence of the overall carcinogenic susceptibility of stem cells in space, whether influenced by cosmic radiation, microgravity, or other stressors as contributing factors, is limited, and needs to be understood to assess the feasibility of growing stem cells in space for use on Earth.</p><p>The costs associated with this sort of research and large-scale production of in-space stem cells for patient use is high and limited by the challenges of launching and performing experiments in space. There is also a need for validation of in-space products for terrestrial applications. Nonetheless, recent scientific research efforts and global forums like the 2020 Biomanufacturing in Space symposium have outlined the foundations required to leverage microgravity in LEO to advance stem cell therapeutics and biomanufacturing for regenerative medicine purposes. An extensive roadmap to overcoming barriers is required where financial investments are coupled with scientific research and innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> . Also, stem cells grown in space for research and subsequent therapies must follow the best practices and guidelines currently in place. This includes abiding by the International Stem Cell Initiative (ICSI) and the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) standard <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74</ref> . Nevertheless, major developments and discoveries addressing stem cells in space have occurred in the past decade alone which can propel this unique branch of regenerative medicine further.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Returning to Earth: requirements and considerations for in-space stem cell use in patients</head><p>While stem cell research in space provides valuable insights into effects of the spaceflight environment on their behavior, including both benefits and existing challenges, their therapeutic translation requires establishing standard safety and functionality protocols and suitable regulatory approvals. The studies in this review show that the spaceflight environment does not harm the different types of stem cells investigated and may enhance their quantity and/or quality. However, it is important to also investigate whether stem cells cultured in space can do their job effectively when back on Earth. It is not enough that stem cells can grow in space and retain their stem cell characteristics. Further studies must investigate the safety, functionality, and feasibility of growing stem cells in space for patient use and make a conclusion about whether the advantages in space outweigh the challenges and costs. Also, they must address whether there is a significant benefit and novelty in choosing to expand stem cells in space than on Earth particularly for clinical use.</p><p>Stem cells grown in space are different to those grown on Earth, and so, specific protocols and safety checkpoints unique to them must be created and followed. Analyses regarding their suitability to be used in cell therapy must be established while passing the required quality control procedures and regulatory guidelines, including further research and clinical trials (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Also, since different types of stem cells react differently in space, a comprehensive framework identifying the stem cell-specific changes which happen are crucial moving forward.</p><p>Expanding stem cells for regenerative medicine applications is a novel therapeutic strategy for many conditions. In this paper, we discussed the innovative approaches to growing stem cells in space for potential use on Earth along with the conflicting data which exists today. The evidence available suggests that microgravity culture conditions may have substantial potential as a cell culture environment for expanding cells with improved therapeutic effects while the full underlying treatment mechanisms remain unclear. Incorporating microgravity into projects of a translational nature may lead to benefits towards patients on Earth to address important developmental and aging disorders, injuries, and diseases across different organ systems. This may bring the scientific community closer to creating promising cellular therapies for debilitating conditions, as well as uncovering pathways and mechanisms about stem cells in a unique environment like space. These results not only give important information fundamental to stem cell biology but enable the further development of LEO-based stem cell research platforms. Therefore, a broader perspective about stem cell applications is possible in space as research continues to explore the use of space for regenerative medicine. • Identity: ensure that the basic identity of space grown stem cells has not significantly changed because of exposure to the space environment. • Purity: characterize the space grown stem cells to ascertain the product's cell composition describing the proportion of stem cells and other differentiated cells. • Sterility: assess the presence of any microbial contamination such as human transmissible bacteria, fungal, known and unknow viral organisms and other adventitious agent. • Safety: determine the safety of space grown stem cells usually in-vitro to assess DNA damage, chromosomal abnormalities, tumorigenicity and in-vivo to assess toxicity, cell distribution and fate. • Potency: evaluate the functional and therapeutic effectiveness of the space grown cells that align with the intended use. This usually involves the use of in-vitro 2D or 3D cell culture system and in-vivo animal models.</p></div>
