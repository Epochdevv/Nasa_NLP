<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The mannose receptor C-type 1 (Mrc1) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed on the immune cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells (ECs) of several tissues, including the bone marrow (BM). Parallel to systemic metabolic alterations and hematopoietic cell proliferation, high-fat diet (HFD) feeding increases the expression of Mrc1 in sinusoidal ECs, thus calling for the investigation of its role in bone marrow cell reprogramming and the metabolic profile during obesity. Mrc1 -/- mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were fed an HFD (45% Kcal/diet) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was monitored during the diet regimen and glucose and insulin tolerance were assessed. Extensive flow cytometry profiling, histological, and proteomic analyses were performed. After HFD feeding, Mrc1 -/-mice presented impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells in parallel with an increase in BM adipocytes compared to controls. Accordingly, circulating levels of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1 -/- mice together with reduced infiltration of macrophages in the visceral adipose tissue and the liver compared to controls. Liver histological profiling coupled with untargeted proteomic analysis revealed that Mrc1 -/-mice presented decreased liver steatosis and the downregulation of proteins belonging to pathways involved in liver dysfunction. This profile was reflected by improved glucose and insulin response and reduced weight gain during HFD feeding in Mrc1 -/-mice compared to controls. Our data show that during HFD feeding, mannose receptor deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, which is associated with reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The mannose receptor (Mrc1) is a unique type 1 transmembrane receptor that is a member of the C-type lectin family. Mrc1 can be located on non-vascular endothelium, macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and dendritic cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> as well as in the serum in a shortened soluble form <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. It presents eight C-type lectin domains (CTLDs), of which only number four is functional, and recognizes mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNac) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Moreover, Mrc1 has a fibronectin type II (FNII) domain with a high affinity for collagen <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, and a terminal cysteine-rich (CR) domain which binds sulfated sugars <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>Because of its complex structure, the mannose receptor recognizes several ligands, including circulating hormones <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref> and adhesion molecules <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. This aspect, together with its wide expression, allows Mrc1 to be involved in several processes including the immune response. It has been proposed that Mrc1 plays a key role during the immune response because of its ability to recognize mannose residues <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, expressed as terminal glycan moiety on lysosomal enzymes released during inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or as part of microbial walls <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and because of its participation in leukocyte trafficking. The mannose receptor expressed on sinusoidal endothelial cells interacts with the highly glycosylated protein CD44 on lymphocytes, directly regulating their trafficking <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Notably, Mrc1 is also expressed in the bone marrow compartment by both macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and sinusoidal endothelium <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which are known to modulate both the proliferation/maturation of hematopoietic stem cells and the extravasation of immune cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Conditions that cause systemic inflammation, such as metabolic disturbances and obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, impair bone marrow hematopoiesis and promote the production of proinflammatory mediators by sinusoidal ECs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. The outcomes of these conditions also activate an immune inflammatory response within several target tissues, including the adipose tissue and the liver. The aims of our study were to investigate <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> the role of the mannose receptor in the bone marrow during obesity development and <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> the relationship between the mannose receptor function and changes in systemic inflammation. We fed Mrc1 -/-and control WT mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks and observed that Mrc1 deficiency resulted in reduced myelopoiesis associated with an increased adipocyte count in the bone marrow. This was associated with a significant reduction of circulating myeloid inflammatory cells together with a reduced infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and in the liver. The improved inflammatory response in Mrc1-deficient mice was paralleled by reduced body weight gain during HFD feeding, reduced liver steatosis, and improved glucose and insulin response compared to WT mice. These data suggest that the mannose receptor could be involved in the development of the immunometabolic response associated with diet-induced obesity.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Mice</head><p>Mrc1 -/-mice on a C57BL/6J background were used and compared to age-matched C57BL/6J wild-type littermates. Four animals were housed per cage and kept in a temperature-controlled environment (20 ± 2 • C, 50 ± 5% relative humidity) with a 12 h light/dark cycle and free access to food and water. Six-to 8-week-old male mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD, 45% Kcal from fat, Cat. No. D12451, Research diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 20 weeks. Weight gain was measured weakly. All mice were sacrificed after overnight fasting using isoflurane (2%) inhalation, and then blood was collected using an intracardiac puncture. We also collected and weighed visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SCAT), brown adipose tissue (BAT) and the liver, femurs, and tibias from the mice. All animal procedures conformed to the guidelines from directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and were approved by the Ethical Committee (Progetto di Ricerca 2012/02, Autorizzazione Ministeriale 929/2020).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Glucose and Insulin Tolerance Tests</head><p>The glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance test (ITT) were used to measure the plasmatic clearance of glucose after intraperitoneal injection of glucose or insulin, respectively. For the GTT, animals were fasted overnight (approximately 14 h) and then blood glucose levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the injection of a glucose solution (10% w/v in physiological solution, 1 mg per gram of body weight). Blood glucose levels were measured with a glucometer (ONE-TOUCH Ultra glucometer, Lifescan, Milpitas, CA, USA). For the ITT, animals were fasted for 4 h and then glucose plasma levels were measured at fasting and after 20, 40, 60, and 120 min from the injection of human recombinant insulin (0.75 mU per gram of body weight, Humulin R U-100, 100 U/mL).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Sample Preparation for Flow Cytometry</head><p>Immunophenotyping was performed on blood or single-cell suspensions that were previously obtained from bone marrow centrifugation (as described in Fan Y. et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>), visceral adipose tissue collagenase digestion (as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>), or liver dissociation and stratification. Whole blood was incubated with an antibody mix for 30 min at 4 • C and then fixed and lysed (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell suspensions from each tissue were stained with the antibody mix at 4 • C for 30 min. Washes and the final resuspension for acquisition were performed using PBS with FBS 2% and EDTA 2 mM. Samples were acquired with LSRFortessa X-20 (BD) and analyzed with Novoexpress software (version 1.6.0, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Further details on tissue preparation are provided in the Supplementary Materials. The antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Table <ref type="table">S1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Femurs, Liver, and Adipose Tissues Histology</head><p>Mouse femurs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 4 h at 4 • C, decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA pH 8 for 5 days at 4 • C, and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Longitudinal femur sections (10 µm thick) were incubated with anti-perilipin 1 antibody (1:200; Cat. No. 9349, Cell Signalling Technology®, Danvers, MA, USA). An anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted to 1:200 in PBS plus 1% BSA was incubated for 40 min at 37 • C. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33342 (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). Images (10×) were acquired with a Leica DM6B automated upright microscope (Leica Biosystems S.r.l., Milan, Italy) and then processed with Fiji/ImageJ software (version 1.50, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Adipocytes were manually quantified with Fiji/ImageJ based on perilipin-1 immunostaining.</p><p>Part of the liver, VAT, SCAT, and BAT was fixed overnight in 4% buffer formalin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) embedded in paraffin and then 5 µm tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) (Sigma-Aldrich). Images of H&amp;Estained sections were acquired using the Axiovision Zeiss software (version 4.8, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 10× magnification. We evaluated liver steatosis using ImageJ software and the adipocytes area of VAT and SCAT using the Adiposoft Plugin, considering two fields per section, for a total of 10 sections per animal. To assess hepatic neutrophil activation, immunohistochemistry staining of liver sections was performed using the Anti-Neutrophil Elastase antibody (1:200; Cat. No. ab68672, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by the HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:750; Sigma-Aldrich), a reaction with DAB Liquid Substrate System (Sigma-Aldrich), and nuclei counterstaining with haematoxylin (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired with Axiovision Zeiss software at 10x magnification and elastase-positive areas were quantified with ImageJ software.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5.">Proteomics Analysis</head><p>A proteomics analysis was performed as previously described <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. Briefly, mice livers (n = 3 WT mice and n = 3 Mrc1 -/-) were pooled up to 20 mg and lysed with urea 8M, Tris-HCl 0.1 M pH 8.5 in the presence of protease inhibitors at a ratio of 1:100 (Cell Signalling, Cat. No. 5872S). The liver samples were then quantified and prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis. For plasma, 30 µL samples (n = 4 WT mice and n = 4 Mrc1 -/-mice) were pooled, and the concentration was quantified by NanoDrop A280 nm (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for LC-MS/MS analysis.

The Mrc1 -/-mice displayed a significant reduction in neutrophils (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1A</ref>) and inflammatory CCR2 + monocyte counts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1B</ref>). Although, the total monocyte numbers were not different between the two experimental groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1C</ref>). A trend toward the reduction of circulating CD11b + myeloid cells was also observed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1D</ref>), whereas the counts of eosinophils (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1E</ref>) and circulating adaptive immune cells, including B and T lymphocytes, were not different (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1F</ref>,<ref type="figure">G</ref>). We next investigated whether this profile might be the consequence of changes in the medullary compartment of Mrc1 -/-as compared to WT male mice following HFD feeding. To this aim, we profiled different hematopoietic precursor subsets and mature immune cells (cell subsets investigated are presented in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref>, and the gating strategy used is presented in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">S3A-R</ref>) in the bone marrow of the different animal models.</p><p>The number of early progenitors was similar in WT and Mrc1 -/-mice, including that of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1H</ref>), short-term hematopoietic stem cells (ST-HSCs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1I</ref>), multipotent progenitors (MPPs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1J</ref>), common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1K</ref>), common myeloid progenitors (CMPs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1L</ref>), and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMPs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1M</ref>). Interestingly, the amount of more mature cells, including granulocyte progenitors (GPs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1N</ref>), pre-neutrophils (PNs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1O</ref>), and mature neutrophils (MNs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1Q</ref>, representative plots Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1W</ref>), were significantly reduced in mice lacking Mrc1 as compared to controls.  Macrophage/dendritic cell progenitors (MDPs; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1R</ref>), monocyte precursors (MOPs, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1S</ref>), and mature Ly6C low (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1T</ref>) and Ly6C high (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1U</ref>) monocytes were not affected. On the other hand, macrophages identified as Gr-1 -CD115 -F4/80 + SSC low decreased in the bone marrow of Mrc1-deficient mice compared to WT mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1V</ref>,<ref type="figure">X</ref>). This last trait was commonly associated with compromised retention of hematopoietic stem cells in the niche <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, often as the consequence of altered crosstalk between the stem cell niche and adipocytes within the bone marrow during hematopoiesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>. To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the content of adipocytes in the bone marrow of Mrc1 -/- mice to control mice using Perilipin as an adipocyte marker with immunofluorescence staining (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1Y</ref>). Adipocyte content significantly increased in association with Mrc1 deficiency both in terms of cells per area and absolute count (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1Z</ref>,AA). The observation of a similar value for adipocyte cell surface area between the experimental groups (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1AB</ref>) suggests that an investigation of differences in bone marrow adipogenesis is required to explain the phenotype described above. Altogether, the decreased presence of macrophages, the combination of reduced levels of myeloid precursors and mature cells, and the increased adipocyte content suggest that the lack of Mrc1 could promote a medullary rewiring in mice with diet-induced obesity. This medullary rewiring is reflected in changes to the circulating immune subsets and systemic inflammatory status.</p><p>To explore this hypothesis, untargeted proteomic analysis of the plasma from the different experimental groups was performed. Out of 4306 proteins identified, 4.4% were downregulated and 3.4% were upregulated in the plasma of obese Mrc1 -/-mice compared to that of controls (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>,<ref type="figure">B</ref>). The different proteomic signature associated with Mrc1 deficiency was confirmed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2C</ref>), which showed a cluster clearly separated from that of plasma proteins from WT mice. To better characterize this phenotype, differently abundant proteins were analyzed using the KEGG database to assess enriched pathways in the plasma of Mrc1 -/-mice compared to that of WT mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2D</ref>). Interestingly, ECM-receptor interaction, leukocyte transendothelial migration, chemokine signaling pathway, and platelet activation (FDR &lt; 0.05) displayed a higher number of downregulated proteins (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2E</ref>,F) in the plasma from Mrc1 -/-mice.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Mrc1 Deficiency in Mice Fed with a High-Fat Diet Impacts Immune Infiltration of Metabolic Tissues during Obesity</head><p>We performed flow cytometry analyses on the visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and liver of WT and Mrc1 -/-mice fed with an HFD for 20 weeks to investigate whether the reduced inflammatory and migratory phenotype of myeloid cells in circulation-as suggested by proteomics analysis-was reflected by different recruitment of immune cells in metabolically affected tissues. Interestingly, the mannose receptor deficiency was associated with a significant reduction in macrophages, specifically in monocyte-derived macrophages (Figure <ref type="figure">3A-C</ref>, gating strategy shown in Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">S4A-I</ref>), within VAT, which suggests a different infiltrating capacity.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>Metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, are associated with increased hematopoiesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and dysfunctional endothelium, which in turn contribute to disrupting myelopoiesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. This pro-inflammatory hematopoiesis not only aggravates the dysmetabolic condition but also stands as an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, calling for an investigation of the molecular mechanisms driving this effect. Intriguingly, the soluble mannose receptor has been shown to stimulate tissue macrophage activation towards inflammation, and its deficiency in mice fed an HFD resulted in reduced tissue inflammation and a better metabolic phenotype <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</p><p>However, the use of a whole-body Mrc1 knock-out mouse model has suggested that the wide range in the expression of this receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> would account for additional activities. In this context, we showed that Mrc1 deficiency results in reduced inflammation that might be the consequence of important changes in bone marrow cell signature.</p><p>Interestingly, Mrc1 is expressed by both macrophages and medullary sinusoidal endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, where its expression increases following the onset of diabetes mellitus within a panel of inflammatory genes <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Highly active myelopoiesis observed in dysmetabolic conditions is commonly associated with a systemic immune activation characterized by the increased frequency of blood inflammatory cells and circulating markers of inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. In our experimental setting, decreased levels of circulating neutrophils and pro-inflammatory CCR2 + monocytes were indeed associated with the bone marrow phenotype switch in Mrc1-deficient mice. Our work revealed that the lack of the mannose receptor modulates myelopoiesis, thus hampering the enhancement observed in animals fed with an HFD to induce obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. We demonstrated an important downregulation of myeloid cell production as well as an increased presence of adipocytes. Considering the role of CXCL12 in promoting HSCs quiescence, an increase in adipocytes, a known source of CXCL12, could negatively modulate hematopoiesis by reducing the production of inflammatory cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. As a confirmation, our plasma proteomics analysis showed that the lack of the mannose receptor is paralleled by an overall reduction in leukocyte migration and the tissue infiltration pathways. Notably, changes in glycoprotein catabolism play a critical role in lipoprotein metabolism and cardiometabolic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</p><p>Therefore, we investigated the immune phenotype of the visceral adipose tissue and liver, as they represent tissues at the crossroad between the metabolic and inflammatory response to obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. In Mrc1-deficient mice, both tissues presented a reduced infiltration of myeloid cells that contributed to an amelioration of the metabolic response during HFD. Indeed, the recruitment of monocytes from circulation to adipose tissue promotes the differentiation of macrophages with a pro-inflammatory phenotype at the cost of anti-inflammatory macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</p><p>Notably, Mrc1 deficiency appears to counterbalance this effect, limiting the immunometabolic response observed during obesity. This finding seems unexpected given that the Mrc1 receptor is one of the key markers of pro-resolutive macrophages <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. However, previous studies have shown that the selective depletion of Mrc1 + macrophages improves the systemic insulin response and lipid handling in adipose tissue <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. These results suggest the presence of parallel mechanisms related to the presence of the mannose receptor that might be associated with the progression of metabolic disorders.</p><p>Of note, in this study, we used whole-body Mrc1 knock-out mice. Therefore, it is possible that cells other than macrophages contributed to the phenotype observed. Indeed, in addition to macrophages, the mannose receptor is expressed by a variety of cells including non-immune cells, such as sinusoidal endothelial cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These cells have been implicated in leucocyte trafficking in lymphatic vessels <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>. Therefore, future studies should investigate whether leucocyte trafficking could also play a role in the observed phenotype.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that, during the onset of obesity, Mrc1 impacts hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and release. In addition, Mrc1 deficiency impacts the BM cell profile and reduces the number of activated immune cells in circulation and their infiltration in tissues, thus dampening obesity development.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1.
