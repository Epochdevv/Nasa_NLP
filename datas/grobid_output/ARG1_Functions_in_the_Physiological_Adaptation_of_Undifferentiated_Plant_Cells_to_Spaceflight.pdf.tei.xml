<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Scientific access to spaceflight and especially the International Space Station has revealed that physiological adaptation to spaceflight is accompanied or enabled by changes in gene expression that significantly alter the transcriptome of cells in spaceflight. A wide range of experiments have shown that plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight involves gene expression changes that alter cell wall and other metabolisms. However, while transcriptome profiling aptly illuminates changes in gene expression that accompany spaceflight adaptation, mutation analysis is required to illuminate key elements required for that adaptation.</p><p>Here we report how transcriptome profiling was used to gain insight into the spaceflight adaptation role of Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1), a gene known to affect gravity responses in plants on Earth. The study compared expression profiles of cultured lines of Arabidopsis thaliana derived from wild-type (WT) cultivar Col-0 to profiles from a knock-out line deficient in the gene encoding ARG1 (ARG1 KO), both on the ground and in space. The cell lines were launched on SpaceX CRS-2 as part of the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment of the BRIC-17 spaceflight mission. The cultured cell lines were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research In Canisters (BRIC) hardware. Spaceflight samples were fixed on orbit. Differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments (spaceflight and comparable ground controls) and the two genotypes (WT and ARG1 KO). Each genotype engaged unique genes during physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, with little overlap. Most of the genes altered in expression in spaceflight in WT cells were found to be Arg1-dependent, suggesting a major role for that gene in the physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to spaceflight.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>M ost multicellular organisms have specialized or- gans, structures, cells, and signaling pathways dedicated to sensing their environment, such as the gravity-sensing columella cells found in the plant root tip <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Sato et al., 2015)</ref>. However, the ability to sense and physiologically adapt to a new environment is not limited to organisms with specialized cells and organs; undifferentiated plant cells lacking specialization engage a complex response when exposed to an environment without gravity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Paul et al., 2012)</ref>. Yet the fundamental question of how an undifferentiated cell senses gravity remains unanswered. Microgravity experimentation, enabled by the International Space Station (ISS), can essentially remove the effects of this ubiquitous force that affects all life on Earth and provide unique experimental information about gravity-sensing mechanisms and gravity-based processes, while also describing the physiological changes needed to survive in spaceflight <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Rea et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Vandenbrink and Kiss, 2016)</ref>. Understanding the events of physiological adaptation in undifferentiated cells in spaceflight advances fundamental knowledge about how cells recognize the gravity stimulus and provides insight as to how gravity-associated signal transduction occurs within a single cell. Both types of insight enhance our ability to prepare for long-term space exploration.</p><p>Even though undifferentiated cells and single-celled organisms lack specialized organs for gravity sensing, they are indeed able to detect changes in gravity and are affected by the spaceflight environment. In the microgravity of spaceflight, cells adapt by making changes to their metabolism that are guided by, and reflected in, differential gene expression when compared to living on the ground <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Salmi and Roux, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Paul et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fengler et al., 2015)</ref>. Further, undifferentiated cells survive and multiply in space, implying that cells manage to reestablish a favorable physiological equilibrium in microgravity <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Paul et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Fengler et al., 2015)</ref>. Individual cells can sense and respond to changes in their gravity environment, but the mechanism by which these signals are received and then transduced is poorly understood. Our work with the response of plants and undifferentiated cell cultures to spaceflight revealed a number of potential molecular constituents that may be involved in gravisensing and adaptation to spaceflight environments. The approach in the present study was to examine patterns of gene expression in undifferentiated cell lines of Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) developed from wild-type Columbia-0 (Col-0) and from Col-0 plants deficient in a known gravity-sensing gene: Altered response to gravity 1 (Arg1).</p><p>Several reasons contributed to the selection of Arg1 for closer study. Central to the decision was the evidence that Arg1 functions in the early events in gravitropic signal transduction in plant roots <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sedbrook et al., 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Blancaflor, 2013)</ref>. During root gravistimulation, ARG1 helps guide the relocalization of membrane-bound auxin efflux carrier proteins-such as PIN2 and PIN3-to the basal side of the statocytes, which contributes to the establishment of a lateral gradient of auxin across the root cap <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abas et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr">Harrison and Masson, 2008b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010)</ref>. Although this process has not been demonstrated in nonstatocyte cells, ARG1 seems to be well positioned for a role in response to gravity in undifferentiated cells as well. Several additional characteristics made Arg1 a particularly interesting subject with regard to undifferentiated cells. Arg1 is expressed throughout the entire plant; it is not a root-specific gene. Further, ARG1 is not localized to plastids and does not appear to be dependent on mechanisms related to amyloplast movement in specialized cells, such as is typified by PGM, another protein linked to gravitropism <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Guan et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stanga et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Morita and Nakamura, 2012)</ref>. Since specialized cells are absent in the cell cultures, the apparent ability of ARG1 to contribute to gravity sensing without these specializations reinforced its candidacy. In addition, ARG1 is localized throughout the endosomal/secretory pathway, enabling it to interact with both vesicular trafficking and integral membrane proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boonsirichai et al., 2003)</ref>. ARG1 localization cycles along the endomembrane system between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boonsirichai et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Stanga et al., 2009)</ref>; thus ARG1 could play a role in gravisensing based on its association with internal cellular structures in the undifferentiated cells. The highly conserved J domain at ARG1's N-terminus, a structural hallmark of proteins involved in stress response and signal transduction <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Caplan et al., 1993;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Kimura et al., 1995)</ref>, also supports a gravisignaling role for ARG1 in the cell. The Jdomain proteins typically function as molecular co-chaperones by interacting with HSC70 <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Young et al., 2003)</ref>, and the ARG1/HSC70 connection has been made in the TOC complex on the outer chloroplast membrane, where it plays a role in protein transfer <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">( Jouhet and Gray, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Su and Li, 2010)</ref>. HSC70 isoform HSP70 is induced by spaceflight in several plant systems <ref type="bibr">(reviewed in Schu ¨ler et al., 2015)</ref>, including undifferentiated cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Paul et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Zupanska et al., 2013)</ref>, strengthening the connection of HSC70 chaperones with gravity sensing and signal transduction. In addition to a J do-main, ARG1 also contains a coiled-coil region in its C-terminus that likely enhances its ability to interact with actin in the cytoskeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Sedbrook et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Boonsirichai et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Harrison and Masson, 2008a)</ref>. The cytoskeleton is central to many models of single-cell gravity sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ingber, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Vorselen et al., 2014)</ref>, and actin has been specifically implicated in gravisensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Kamada et al., 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kwon et al., 2015)</ref>. Thus ARG1's extensive role in targeted protein distribution, signal transduction, and interaction with cytoskeleton makes it a strong candidate for a role in gravity responses in undifferentiated cells.</p><p>Cell lines from wild-type (WT) Col-0 and an ARG1 knock-out (ARG1 KO) in the same Col-0 background were launched to the ISS for the CEL experiment, which was a component of the Biological Research In Canisters-17 (BRIC-17) payload. The experiments described here compare samples fixed in orbit after growth in space to comparable samples grown in precisely the same hardware on the ground. The focus of the experiment was to evaluate the overall effect of the spaceflight environment on these cells.</p><p>The objective of these experiments was to develop a better understanding of the sensitivity of undifferentiated cells to the spaceflight environment and, in particular, test the effect of removing Arg1, a gene we hypothesized would be a gene of importance to the adaptive process. The utilization of this mutant also revealed genes important to spaceflight adaptation that would not normally be recognized, as they are not differentially regulated by spaceflight in WT cells. In the case of these genes, the level at which they are expressed on the ground in WT cells is the level that is also required in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, so no differential expression is seen between ground and spaceflight in WT cells. However, if the expression levels on the ground are altered for these genes, as can be found in a mutant cell line such as ARG1 KO, then the expression levels must be adjusted to the normal WT levels to enable spaceflight adaptation. Thus the altered expression level of these genes is irrelevant for the ground adaptation but is important for the spaceflight adaptation.</p><p>The results of the spaceflight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding of ARG1's role in adjusting to this novel environment and have also enabled us to look further into the adaptive process engaged by cells lacking specific, differentiated cells and organs for environmental sensing.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Concept of operations and comparison approach</head><p>When a cell transitions from Earth to orbit, it responds and begins to adjust its metabolism to the stimuli offered by the new environment. In this experiment, the patterns of gene expression established after 10 days of growth in the BRIC hardware were used to illuminate the strategies undifferentiated cells used to physiologically adapt to the spaceflight environment. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part approach. First, differentially expressed genes were identified between cells grown in the two environments: spaceflight and the comparable ground controls. The genes identified in this ''vertical'' comparison reflected physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment within each genotype. Second, differentially expressed genes were identified between wild-type (WT) and arg1 mutant (ARG1 KO) genotypes. The genes identified in this ''horizontal'' genotype comparison showed the impact of removing ARG1 from metabolic processes in both the normal ground control environment as well as in the spaceflight environment. Comparing gene expression patterns revealed potential roles for ARG1 in both environments. An overview is shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> and details of the approach provided below.</p><p>This first analytical approach involves the typical comparison of the gene expression profiles of spaceflight-grown cells to the ground controls for each of the two cell lines, thereby characterizing the physiological adaptation of each genotype to spaceflight (red box in Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref> and red arrows in 1B). Genes identified in WT cells contribute to understanding which cellular processes were sensitive to microgravity and spaceflight. If physiological adaptation to spaceflight depends entirely on functional Arg1, then the ARG1 KO cell line would be in severe decline, and the spaceflight-to-ground gene expression profiles would reflect that stress. If ARG1 is not involved in physiological adaptation to spaceflight, then the spaceflight-to-ground gene expression profiles from ARG1 KO cells would be largely the same as WT. However if ARG1 functions simply as part of the pathways engaged by spaceflight, then the pattern of genes differentially expressed to adapt to spaceflight will differ between WT and the knockout cell line but retain some degree of overlap.</p><p>The second analytical approach involves the comparison of gene expression profiles between WT and ARG1 KO cells both on the ground and during spaceflight (green and blue box of Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref> and green and blue arrows of 1B). This approach reveals gene expression differences in the cells adapted to either environment with a disabled Arg1 gene. Since ARG1 has a role in typical cell maintenance, it was likely that the gene expression profiles of ARG1 KO cell culture would differ from WT in the ground environment, as a knock-out cell line would adapt its metabolism to compensate for the absence of the important gene. Since the gene expression patterns on the ground will likely affect the nature of adaptation to spaceflight, it is important to compare the gene expression profiles between the two genotypes of the ground controls (green box of Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref> and green arrows of 1B).</p><p>Finally, every individual gene engaged in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight experiment was examined in the ARG1 KO cells to determine whether the gene was similarly expressed or changed in the knock-out line. If a gene was changed in the same way in both genotypes, then we concluded it was Arg1 independent. However, if a gene was not engaged in the ARG1 KO cells, or was engaged in a different manner than in the WT cells, then the expression of that gene in the WT adaptation to spaceflight was determined to be dependent upon ARG1 function.</p><p>2.1.1. The CEL experiment of BRIC-17. The CEL experiment setup and organization was a modification of a previous Arabidopsis cell culture experiment in BRIC-16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Paul et al., 2012)</ref>. The CEL BRIC-17 experiment was launched on board the Dragon capsule of the SpaceX-2 Commercial Resupply Service (CRS) mission to the ISS on 1 March 2013. The cultured cell lines (both the ground control and the spaceflight samples) were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the BRIC hardware. The BRIC hardware remains stationary after it is destowed from the Dragon Capsule and deployed to the ISS. The BRIC hardware does not have a centrifuge component, nor is it compatible with the limited centrifuge facilities on the ISS,</p></div>

Additional hardware details and BRIC illustrations can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Paul et al. (2012)</ref>. The experiment made a direct comparison of spaceflight-grown cells to those grown as controls on the ground for the purpose of exploring the complete range of effects that spaceflight presents to plant cells, which includes but is not limited to the effects of microgravity. Two BRIC containers (A and B) were assigned to CEL within the BRIC-17 payload. Each chamber housed five PDFUs, each PDFU holding one 60 mm Petri plate. In each BRIC container there were two plates with WT cells and three plates with knock-out cells of two genotypes. The exact same PDFU composition was recapitulated in BRIC containers on the ground in the International Space Station Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) as ground controls. The ground controls were initiated with a 48 h delay so that the precise temperature environment of the ISS could be recreated for the ground controls in the ISSES chamber. Cells were fixed on the ISS with RNAlaterÔ (Ambion) on the 10 th day on orbit, and the ground controls were fixed 48 h later. RNAlater fixation was initiated by the crew using an activation tool that moves RNAlater from a storage container in the PDFU into the Petri plate. Twenty four hours after fixation, the entire BRIC was moved to the Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI), where it resided until cold stowage transport back to Earth within the Dragon capsule. After returning to Earth, the samples were reclaimed at KSC and then transported to the University of Florida laboratories. As described below, the total RNA was extracted from spaceflight samples and corresponding ground control samples and subjected to microarrays. Although the BRIC hardware has virtually no air circulation, no gas exchange, and no light, that hardware configuration is not substantially different from the normal growing conditions of the undifferentiated tissue culture cells, which are typically grown in sealed Petri plates in the dark <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">( Johnson et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>

Each cell line was initiated simultaneously approximately 6 months before launch. Cells derived from hypocotyls were grown and maintained on plates with solid media containing MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins (1 mL of 1000 • solution), 2,4-D (0.3 mL/L), 0.5% agar (5 g/L) and kinetin (0.2 mg/L) until dedifferentiated into callus.

Two cell lines each of Col-0 ecotype were the subject of this study: WT and arg1, the latter being a knock-out line generated from the ARG1 T-DNA insertion (SALK_024542C). The arg1 cell line is referred to as ARG1 KO throughout. The SALK line was obtained through TAIR. The SALK mutant line (arg1-3) is characterized by a T-DNA insertion at position 952 (in an intron).

The liquid media was decanted, the material washed once with fresh liquid media, and then the sample was decanted again. A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 g of cells on the surface of a 60 mm Petri plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, USA) that contained 6.5 mL nutrient agar media [MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins, 2,4-D MES buffer (0.5 g/L), 0.8% agar (8 g/L)]. The cells were then dispersed evenly across the surface. All plate manipulations were conducted under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood to ensure sterility of both the interior and exterior of the plates. Plates were put into a sterile NalgeneÔ BioTransport Carrier (Thermo Scientific), each layer of plates separated with a sterile non-skid plastic insert. The BioTransporter was then sealed with gas-permeable tape (3M), wrapped in Steri-WrapÔ autoclave wraps (Fisher), and then driven to KSC. The BRIC-17 CEL experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SSPF (Space Station Processing Facility) at KSC 48 h before the scheduled launch time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.7.">Real quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction, RT-qPCR</head><p>The total RNA (850 ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using High Capacity RNA to cDNA Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). One-tenth of total cDNA was used as a template for a single RT-qPCR run. RT-qPCR was carried out using TaqManÔ technology on the ABI 7500 Fast instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The TaqManÔ Fast Advanced Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) reagent was used for the duplex RT-qPCR reaction with 6FAM and VIC-dye labeled, TAMRA-quenched probes. In all reactions the Ubq11 (At4g05050) served as an internal control. Each duplex PCR mixture contained 900 nM target gene-specific forward and reverse primers each, 150 nM Ubq11 forward and reverse primers each, 250 nM 6FAM labeled target gene-specific probe, and 250 nM VIC-labeled Ubq11 probe. Primers and probes were designed with Primer Express software and supplied by Applied Biosystems. The primers/probes sequences shown as 5¢/3¢ were as follows: Ubq11 (At4g05050) forward: AACTTGAGGA CGGCAGAACTTT, reverse: GTGATGGTCTTTCCGGTC AAA3, probe: VIC-CAGAAGGAGTCTACGCTTCATTT GGTCTTGC-TAMRA; Agp12 (At3g13520) forward: TCT CCGCCGTAGGAAACGT, reverse: AGCATCGGAAGT AGGACTTGGA, probe: 6FAM-CTGCGCAGACAGAG GCTCCGG-TAMRA; Skb1 (At4g31120) forward: TGA TACCTCAGAGGGACTGAATGAT, reverse: GCTTAC TGTCATGCTCACAAAGAAG, probe: 6FAM-CCTGGGA GCTGTGGAATTCGTTTCG-TAMRA; HsfA2 (At2g26150) forward: GGTGTGCTTGTAGCTGAGGTAGTTAG, reverse: TGCTCCATAGCTGCAACTTGA, probe: 6FAM-TTGAGGCAACAGCAACACAGCTCCA-TAMRA.</p><p>Real quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed as reported previously. Briefly, the thermal cycling program consisted of 20 s at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 3 s at 95°C, and 30 s at 59°C. Reactions were quantified by threshold cycle, Ct. Primers and probe sets were first subjected to validation experiments to test the efficiency of the target and reference amplifications. The Ct values for respective number of biological replicas of each experimental group (treated, control) were analyzed using 7500 Software v2.0.5 along with Microsoft Excel and the comparative CT(DDCT) method. The DCt was calculated as the difference between the threshold cycle value of a target gene and that of Ubq11 (endogenous control) in the same sample, while DDCt was calculated as the difference between the DCt value of a treated sample and that of the control (calibrator). The fold difference of the target gene expression in treated samples relative to control samples (calibrator) was calculated as 2^(-DDCt) and then log2-transformed.</p></div>

First, differentially expressed genes were identified between the two environments: spaceflight cells and comparable ground controls, which reflected the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment. Second, differentially expressed genes were identified between the two genotypes: WT and ARG1 KO cells, which provide a comparison of cell responses in spaceflight and on the ground. Figure <ref type="figure">1A</ref> and 1B illustrates the matrix that was used to compare the two genotypes and two environmental conditions of this experiment: Ground Control WT (G Wt ), Ground Control ARG1 KO (G Arg ), Spaceflight WT (F Wt ), and Spaceflight ARG1 KO (F Arg ).

Differentially expressed genes in all four comparison groups 3.2.1. Alterations in the expression of 78 genes characterize the physiological adaptation of WT cells to spaceflight-F Wt : G Wt . The genes involved in physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment were identified for WT cells by comparing the gene expression profiles in WT spaceflight cells (F Wt ) to WT ground control cells (G Wt ) in the F Wt : G Wt group comparison (Fig. <ref type="figure">1B</ref>). In that comparison 78 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the two cell treatments at p value &lt;0.01 and log2 Fold Change &gt;1; 46 genes were upregulated, and 32 genes were downregulated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> Gene list 78).</p><p>The functional annotation of the genes of the F Wt : G Wt group comparison indicated that genes of the endomembrane system, Golgi apparatus, and plant-type cell wall were highly represented in the WT adaptation to spaceflight. For instance, genes localized to Golgi apparatus were all upregulated in the WT spaceflight cells compared to the ground counterparts (e.g., At3g18260 Reticulon family protein; At1g77510 PDIL1-2 PDI-like 1-2 protein disulfide isomerase-like 1-2 localized to the endomembrane system; At4g07960 CSLC12 cellulose-synthase-like C12 and At2g03760 ST1 sulphotransferase 12; Table <ref type="table">1 GO 78;</ref> <ref type="table">Table S1 Gene list 78</ref>). The defense response group was also highly represented among the Biological Process ontology (gProfiler, TAIR, AgriGO), with pathogen/cell wall-associated genes At3g43250, At2g44490 (PEN2), and At2g03760 (ST1) being upregulated.</p><p>3.2.2. Cells lacking functional Arg1 changed the expression of 130 genes to adapt to spaceflight, and those genes were fundamentally different than those of WT cells-F Arg : G Arg .

There were 130 genes significantly differentially expressed between spaceflight and ground control at p value &lt;0.01 and log2 Fold Change &gt;1; 68 genes were upregulated, and 62 genes were downregulated (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> Gene list 130).</p><p>The functional annotation of the genes of the F Arg : G Arg group comparison indicated that physiological adaptation of the ARG1 KO cells relied on metabolic processes distinct from those used in WT cells. Genes of the cell periphery from the GO Cellular Components category, response to hormone and response to lipid, and xyloglucan metabolic process of the GO Biological Processes, and transporter activity from the GO Molecular Function categories, were highly represented among the genes ARG1 KO cells differentially expressed to adapt to spaceflight.

When the 130 genes differentially expressed in the F Arg : G Arg group comparison were compared to the 78 genes differentially expressed in the F Wt : G Wt group comparison, only three genes changed in the exact same way: At3g08590 putative 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase, At3g30843 hypothetical protein, and At5g56270 transcription factor WRKY2 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, Table <ref type="table">S1</ref> Gene list 78 and Table <ref type="table">S2</ref> Gene list 130). These three genes, therefore, constitute the only genes of the WT response that are totally independent of ARG1 function. The remaining 127 genes of the ARG1 adaptation to the spaceflight environment constitute an adaptation unique to the ARG1 KO genotype.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">The gene expression patterns on the ground play a fundamental role in the gene expression patterns of spaceflight-comparing G Arg : G Wt</head><p>The information about the expression pattern of the 90 genes differentially expressed on the ground between the WT and ARG1 KO cells, G Arg : G Wt , was assessed in all other comparison groups: the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells, F Wt : G Wt , the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells, F Arg : G Arg , and between genotypes in spaceflight, F Arg : F Wt (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>The 25 genes of the 90 (G Arg : G Wt ) showed significantly differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells, F Arg : G Arg , but no significant differential expression in WT cells, F Wt : G Wt (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, <ref type="figure">Category  I</ref>). Thus the ARG1 KO cells corrected the expression of those genes as they adapted to spaceflight, apparently to reestablish the WT level of expression that is needed in that environment. These genes included, for example, At1g32950 (Subtilase genes commonly associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism) and At2g36830 (TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein) (Table 5 GO Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S5</ref> Gene list Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>The 12 genes out of 90 (G Arg : G Wt ) showed significant differential expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells (F Wt : G Wt ) but no significant expression in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (F Arg : G Arg ) (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, Category II). This genotype-based change in the ARG1 KO ground control cells resulted in the expression levels of these genes on the ground matching the WT expression levels in spaceflight. There was a single gene (At2g40020, hypothetical histone-lysine N-methyltransferase protein) among these 12 with an unusual behavior, as it was also differentially expressed in spaceflight between the two genotypes. However all 12 genes were considered to be expressed in the ARG1 KO on the ground at the level required for the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight.</p><p>These genes included genes associated with the extracellular region (e.g., At1g30600 Subtilase family protein; At1g10740 lipase; At1g13080 CYP71B2 cytochrome P450; At1g07380 ceramidase activity; At2g44490 PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism; Table 5 GO Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S5</ref> Gene list Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>The 53 genes out of 90 (G Arg : G Wt ) showed no differential expression in any other comparison group (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>, Category III). Thus, although the gene expression patterns between genotypes on the ground were different, both cell lines likely made only small adjustments to gene expression, which resulted in no change in expression levels when the two genotypes from spaceflight were compared. Some of these genes represented plasma membrane and membrane related processes: At4g11850 PLDGAMMA1 phospholipase D gamma, At2g02170 Remorin family protein, At5g52440 HCF106 Bacterial sec-independent translocation protein mttA/Hcf1061 importing protein into chloroplast thylakoid membrane, At5g39500 GNL1 GNOM-like 1 participating in the ER body organization, endocytosis and the retrograde vesicle-mediated transport, Golgi to ER (Table 5 GO Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>; Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">S5</ref> Gene list Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>).</p><p>With the exception of At2g40020, none of the 90 genes that were differentially expressed between genotypes on the ground (G Arg : G Wt ) showed differential expression between genotypes in the spaceflight environment (F Arg : F Wt ).  <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">S6</ref> Gene list 102 CORRECTED Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>).

Also, cellular aromatic compound metabolic process, localization, and transmembrane transport were represented among the Biological Process ontology terms. Two genes represented the cellular aromatic compound metabolic process (At4g37650 SHR GRAS family transcription factor and At3g20540 PolIB polymerase gamma 1).

The Arg1-dependent genes in the WT adaptive strategy-comparing F Wt : G Wt and F Arg : G Arg . The 78 genes significantly differentially expressed between the ground and spaceflight in WT cells established the base of genes needed to adapt to spaceflight. Each gene of 78 F Wt : G Wt was categorized into Arg1-independent, Arg1dependent, or partially Arg1-dependent.</p><p>A gene was considered Arg1 independent if it showed the same expression behavior during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment in both WT and ARG1 KO cells; thus the same change in gene expression was observed in F Wt : G Wt and F Arg : G Arg (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>). The expression of such a gene was adapted to the spaceflight environment in the same fashion regardless of the Arg1 mutation. There were three genes where Arg1 seemed to have no role in the physiological adaptation (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref> Category I; Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> Gene list 78 DE-PENDENCE Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>A gene was considered Arg1 dependent if it did not show the same expression behavior during the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment in ARG1 KO cells, F Arg : G Arg , as it did in WT cells F Wt : G Wt (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>). There were 24 genes exhibiting the Arg1 dependence (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref> Categories II, III, Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>These 24 Arg1-dependent genes could be divided into two categories based on the source of the Arg1 dependency: Category II or III of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>. Category II genes of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref> were not differentially expressed in either the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (F Arg : G Arg ) or ground genotype comparison (G Arg : G Wt ), but showed differential expression in the spaceflight genotype comparison (F Arg : F Wt ). Thus, the absence of a functional Arg1 gene had the impact of rendering the adaptive-to-spaceflight genes unresponsive (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>, Category II). The majority of those genes were associated with the endomembrane system and Golgi apparatus or the intracellular membrane-bounded organelle and cell periphery and plasma membrane GO terms of the Cellular Component ontology (e.g., At3g49780, PSK4 phytosulfokine 4 precursor and At2g43240, Nucleotide-sugar transporter family protein) (Table <ref type="table">8</ref> GO DEPENDENCE Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). Category III genes of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref> were not differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells (F Arg : G Arg ), were differentially expressed in ground genotype comparison (G Arg : G Wt ), but showed no differential expression in spaceflight genotype comparison (F Arg : F Wt ). These genes were already altered on the ground in ARG1 KO cells to match the spaceflight expression levels in WT (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>, Category III). There were 12 genes showing such an expression pattern, some of which were associated with plant defense and cell wall metabolism (e.g., At1g30600, Subtilase family protein; At1g10740 alpha/beta-Hydrolases superfamily protein and At2g44490, PEN2 Glycosyl hydrolase superfamily protein) (Table <ref type="table">8</ref> GO DEPENDENCE Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>There were 51 differentially expressed genes in F Wt : G Wt that were not significantly differentially expressed in any other comparison group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>, Category IV). These genes were considered Arg1 Partially Dependent as there was not enough statistical support to assign them to either the independent or dependent group. These 51 genes were primarily associated with the GO Biological Process of response to stimulus, with few related to the response to light (e.g., At3g08570 Phototropic-responsive NPH3 family protein, At5g63600 FLS5 flavonol synthase 5, At1g76570 Chlorophyll A-B binding family protein or to high light stimulus At1g77510 PDIL1-2 PDI-like 1-2) (Table <ref type="table">8</ref> GO DEPENDENCE Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>; Table <ref type="table">S8</ref> Gene list 78 DEPENDENCE Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>).</p><p>The distribution of 78 genes significantly differentially expressed between the ground and spaceflight in WT cells (F Wt : G Wt ) among the Independent, Dependent, and Partially Dependent was established with increasingly relaxed p value stringency criteria from p value &lt;0.01 through p value &lt;0.05 without changing the stringency of the Fold Change criteria (-1&lt; FC log2 &gt;+1) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>). The number of Independent genes increased from three through five up to six genes. The Dependent genes not only increased in total numbers, but a new group of Dependent genes emerged. The three to four genes showed the new expression pattern such that they were coordinately differentially expressed in WT spaceflight adaptation (F Wt : G Wt ) and in the ground genotype comparison between WT and ARG1 KO cells (G Arg : G Wt ) yet the opposite in the ARG1 KO spaceflight adaptation (F Arg : G Arg ) and in the spaceflight genotype comparison between the WT and ARG1 KO cells (F Arg : F Wt ) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B Category V</ref>). The biggest depletion of gene total number was in the Partially Dependent gene pool, from 51 genes at the p value &lt;0.01, through 43, 37, 35, and 31 at the p value &lt;0.05 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref> Category IV).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Discussion</head><p>The gene Arg1 was found to have a dramatic influence on the gene expression profiles that define physiological adaptation of cell cultures to spaceflight. Like WT cells, the ARG1 KO cells thrived in the spaceflight environment, suggesting that the presence of ARG1 is not absolutely required for physiological adaptation to spaceflight. However, the ARG1 has an essential role in defining the WT adaptation to spaceflight. ARG1 KO cells adapted to spaceflight by expressing different genes, providing unique insight into the alternative pathways for physiological adaptation of undifferentiated cells to the spaceflight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">WT adaptation to spaceflight is highly dependent upon Arg1</head><p>There were 78 genes differentially expressed in WT when comparing spaceflight to ground control. Those 78 genes comprise the obvious primary set of genes involved in spaceflight physiological adaptation of WT cells. Only three of these 78 genes were similarly changed in ARG1 KO cells, suggesting that only these three were completely independent of Arg1 (See Independent group below and in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>, Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref> Category I, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A Category I</ref>). The remaining 75 genes are most likely reliant on Arg1 function. Twenty-four of these genes are definitively dependent upon Arg1 at the highest levels of analytical stringency (Categories II, III of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>). The remaining 51 genes are likely to be dependent upon Arg1 but do not reach p value of &lt;0.01 (Category IV of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref>); however, reducing the required p value level brings more genes from the Partially Dependent group into the clearly Dependent group (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5B</ref>). This result strongly suggests that Arg1 has a prominent role in generating a large part of what would be considered the proper spaceflight gene expression profile for spaceflight adaptation in WT cells.</p><p>4.2 Without functional Arg1, cells engage a unique gene expression strategy that further illuminates required elements of the WT spaceflight adaptation ARG1 KO cells engaged vastly different genes to adapt to spaceflight than did WT cells, suggesting that not only is Arg1 function required for much of the WT adaptation to spaceflight, but also that cells without Arg1 can compensate for the lack of Arg1 by changing the expression of a different set of genes. This suggests that the genotype, and likely then physiological state, of the cell line on the ground profoundly affects the genes engaged in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment.</p><p>The gene expression profiles seen in the ground genotype comparisons suggested that WT and ARG1 KO cells have different gene expression requirements for the maintenance of a healthy physiology in a normal terrestrial environment.</p><p>The basis for engaging very different genes in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in the ARG1 KO can be explained along two lines of reasoning. First, some genes involved in WT adaptation to spaceflight were already changed to a spaceflight-adapted level in ARG1 KO on the ground and were therefore not needed to be differentially expressed as the ARG1 KO adapted to spaceflight (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Category II, 12 genes). These genes are Required in that they must be maintained at the WT spaceflight level in order for these cells to adapt to spaceflight. Second, some of the genes that showed differential expression on the ground between the ARG1 KO and WT cells were Corrected to match WT expression levels during the ARG1 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight (Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref> Category I, 25 genes; the same 25 genes found in Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref> Category II). These genes define a new part of the overall landscape of genes involved in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight: those which are needed to be at a certain level of expression in spaceflight, but if that level is already present in ground transcriptome, it is not necessary to alter expression patterns to achieve the spaceflight transcriptome. However, if their expression on the ground is altered due to confounding factors, such as a mutant background or physiological stress, then expression levels would need to be corrected for spaceflight transcriptome, thereby revealing essential genes that would otherwise be missed.</p><p>An additional set of Corrected genes are those that are differentially expressed in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in ARG1 KO. The 77 genes from Category III (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>) comprise such a group. As with the Category II genes in Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>, these genes were corrected to WT spaceflight levels during the ARG1 KO adaptation to spaceflight. Taken together, these 77 genes plus the aforementioned 25 reveal 102 genes that comprise a previously unappreciated part of the spaceflight adaptation process.</p><p>Some of the genes that showed differential expression in ARG1 KO cells in spaceflight adaptation were also differentially expressed between ARG1 KO and WT cells in spaceflight. These 25 genes apparently Compensated for the absence of a functional Arg1 both on the ground and during spaceflight (25 labeled with an asterisk, Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>, Category IV). These genes would not be a part of the typical WT spaceflight response but are necessary in the ARG1 KO to adapt to spaceflight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">The landscape of genes required for physiological adaptation to spaceflight</head><p>The landscape of the genetic requirements for spaceflight adaptation is much more complex than is revealed by the genes that are changed in expression in WT cells adapted to spaceflight. The complexity of the physiological adaptive processes related to genotype is represented in the Venn diagram of Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. In the WT response 78 genes are changed in expression, leading to the conclusion that these are the genes necessary for adaptation. ARG1 KO data suggest that this is an overly simple view of the adaptation requirements of WT cells. ARG1-mutant cells show that many genes whose expression is altered on the ground by that genotype must be corrected to WT levels to adapt to spaceflight.</p><p>These observations suggest that adaptation of a cell line to spaceflight is highly dependent on its physiological state, which is in turn guided by its genotype. The two cell lines in this study arrived at a different gene expression profile on orbit and changed expression of a different set of genes to get to that profile. Therefore, it is likely that there is no single gene expression profile that defines the spaceflightadapted state for Arabidopsis cells. Rather each cell type and genotype will have a largely unique-appearing change in gene expression profiles in adapting to spaceflight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.">Biological implications of the gene expression profiles</head><p>The agriGO PAGE tool (<ref type="url" target="http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/">http://systemsbiology.cau.edu.cn/</ref> agriGOv2/) was used to evaluate specifically enriched biological processes in each of the comparison sets (Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). In addition, the potential roles of individual genes comprising the differential expression groups of the landscape described above (Independent, Dependent, Required, Corrected, Compensated; Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) were examined in more detail.</p><p>The PAGE analysis revealed that although individual genes may differ in each expression set, those genes are largely representative of the same biological processes, suggesting different paths can be taken to arrive at the same destination. For instance, processing all 180 Important (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>) genes in PAGE indicated some variety in the biological processes engaged in each spaceflight-to-ground, and genotype-to-genotype, comparison. If the gene sets comprising the subcategories on Important genes are processed (Independent, Dependent, Partially Dependent, and Corrected; Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>), there were no significant differences in the general biological processes used by the two genotypes to physiologically adapt to spaceflight (middle panels Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>). In other words, depending on the initial resources available in a cell's metabolic ''tool box,'' slightly different routes of approach appear to be utilized to converge on the same basic adaptive strategies. A closer look at the genomic strategies used by WT and ARG1 KO cells to navigate diverse routes to a common goal revealed genes essential to spaceflight adaptation, including genes that would be masked if we were to have simply essayed WT response strategies alone. Although there was not always a common functionally binding them together, in many cases, genes comprising each category defined above were often aligned in strategic roles.</p><p>4.4.1. Independent genes. The genes of this small category are tied together by potential roles in the detection and maintenance of cell polarity. The most highly induced of the Independent genes is a WRKY2 (At5g56270) transcription factor known to play a major role in the establishment of cell polarity by regulating apical/basal cell fate by activating WOX8 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">( Jeong et al., 2016)</ref>.

Curculin-like genes have also been implicated in the regulatory network that establishes the adaxial/abaxial surfaces in Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Reinhart et al., 2013)</ref>, which also connects to the regulatory pathways that guide polarity in plant cells.</p><p>4.4.2. Dependent genes. There were 75 genes that were at least somewhat dependent on a functional Arg1, many of which were transcription factors associated with the regulation of hormone signaling and cell proliferation. The two most highly induced genes were transcription factors bZIP16 and APD1. Factor bZIP16 primarily functions as a transcriptional repressor of genes responsive to light, gibberellic acid (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Hsieh et al., 2012)</ref>, while RING-finger protein APD1 (ABERRANT POLLEN DEVELOPMENT1) is associated with pollen development and with signaling in the 9-Lipoxygenase pathway central to root development and pathogen defense <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Qin et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Walper et al., 2016)</ref>. This latter role could connect it to another highly induced gene in this category: PSK4, which encodes a precursor to Phytosulfokine 4, one of a family of cell wall receptors that function in cell proliferation, expansion, and wound repair <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Tameshige et al., 2015)</ref>. Interestingly, PSK4 has been shown to promote callus growth in root explants and, further, is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by subtilase SBT1, a gene which is also induced in spaceflight in ARG1 KO cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chevalier et al., 2005)</ref>. The gene SRF5 appears to be a member of the STRUBBELIG family of transmembrane receptor-like kinases that contribute to the regulation of cell morphogenesis and proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chevalier et al., 2005)</ref>. 4.4.3. Required genes. Among the Dependent genes there were also 12 genes differentially expressed between WT and ARG1 KO cells on the ground, which were further subcategorized as Required (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5A</ref> Category III); many of the Required genes were associated with pathogen response. Among the highly induced were an uncharacterized lipase that has been associated with auxin signaling and pathogen response, a cytochrome450 (CYP71B2) that has shown downregulation in response to pathogens, and PEN2, which encodes a glycosyl hydrolase that is essential for defense against powdery mildew in barley <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Schenk et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cabrera et al., 2014)</ref>. Likewise with the three upregulated genes encoding proteases-one encoding a Subtilase family protein that has a role in processing a cell wall pectin methylesterase, another was a member of the cystatin/monellin superfamily of proteases, a group which plays a role in pathogen resistance, and finally a ubiquitin-like protease <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Senechal et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">van Wyk et al., 2014)</ref>. A gene involved in sphingolipid metabolism (neutral/alkaline non-lysosomal ceramidase) was also upregulated. Sphingolipids are a class of lipid signaling molecules that play a role in the apoptotic processes associated with plant pathogen defense, which also ties this Required gene to defenserelated metabolism <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Berkey et al., 2012)</ref>. There was one downregulated gene in this group of genes: an uncharacterized Zinc knuckle (CCHC-type) family protein (At2g12880). A survey of GEO profiles reveals that At2g12880 is highly overexpressed in Arabidopsis mutants of subunit 4 (CSN4) of the COP9 signalosome responsible for the regulation of auxin response <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Huang et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>The abundance of pathogen response and cell wall-related genes in this category suggests that Arg1 plays a role in cell wall remodeling even in the absence of other environmental stimuli, a role that is consistent with ARG1's function within the endomembrane delivery system. 4.4.4. Corrected genes. The 102 genes in the Corrected group (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref>, Categories II and III) represent a truly unique and fascinating category of genes-these are genes that, while required for spaceflight adaptation, would not have been revealed by a spaceflight-to-ground comparison in WT cells. About a tenth of the 102 genes corrected to WT levels in the ARG1 KO cells in the spaceflight transcriptome are associated with transport processes. Genes encoding proteins that play a role in the transport of amino acids (Transmembrane amino acid transporter family protein), small molecules (MATE efflux family protein, RSH2 root hair specific 2), water (TIP1;1 gamma tonoplast intrinsic protein), sugar (SPSA1 sucrose phosphate synthase 1F), metal ions (HMA5 heavy metal ATPase 5), and protons (NHX2 sodium hydrogen exchanger 2) all had expression adjusted to levels comparable to the spaceflight transcriptome of WT cells. This is another instance where the association of ARG1 with intracellular vesicle trafficking <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Boonsirichai et al., 2003)</ref> supports a role for ARG1 in spaceflight adaptation, as cells lacking Arg1 show impairment in the intracellular transport among cell compartments. Further, the abundance of the transporter genes brought to the WT expression levels in the ARG1 KO spaceflight transcriptome could suggest that the transmembrane transport processes may be affected by a reduced gravity environment and that a certain level of transporter gene expression is required to assure the efficient continuum of their performance.</p><p>Genes associated with hormone-mediated signaling are also well represented among the genes that are corrected to WT levels in the ARG1 KO spaceflight transcriptome. Examples include WD domain, G-beta repeat protein gene, SRL2 phytochrome interacting factor 4, and UNS2 Acyl-CoA N-acyltransferases (NAT) These genes are associated primarily with plant growth, cell expansion and architecture, and morphogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Lehman et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Schwab et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Saedler et al., 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Nomoto et al., 2012)</ref>, suggesting that the cell growth may need to be adjusted in spaceflight and that a certain level expression of development-related genes may be required. 4.4.5. Compensated genes. There were 107 genes that appear to help compensate for the lack of Arg1 in cells (Fig. <ref type="figure">4A</ref> Category IV; Fig. <ref type="figure">4B</ref>). Together, these 107 genes define the genotype-specific strategy employed by cells lacking an active Arg1 gene to physiologically adapt to the spaceflight environment, and provide a link to the role of Arg1 in adapting to spaceflight (Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>).</p><p>Genes associated with cell-wall metabolism figure prominently in this category. For example, genes participating primarily in molecular grafting of xyloglucan chains such as At1g68560, alpha-xylosidase 1, and the two xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases, XTH9 (At4g03210) and XTH4 (At2g06850), were significantly downregulated in ARG1 KO in spaceflight transcriptome compared to WT cells. This activity suggests that the process of splitting and/or reconnection of the xyloglucan cross-links in the cell wall occurred in the spaceflight in cells lacking Arg1 in a manner different from WT cells. Further, the repression of these cell-wall remodeling genes indicates that cell-wall loosening processes and cell expansion were diminished in spaceflight when Arg1 gene is absent. It is well documented that cell wall remodeling is a component of both spaceflight adaptation and as a response to hypergravity <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Nedukha, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Soga et al., 1999</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Soga et al., , 2002;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Paul et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Kwon et al., 2015)</ref>. The synthesis and assembly of many cell wall components are dependent on the Golgi apparatus and transport vesicles to the plasma membrane. Genes involved in intracellular transport were also highly represented in those differentially expressed in spaceflight transcriptomes when Arg1 function was disabled. For instance, the genes associated with vesicle-mediated transport such as Prenylated RAB acceptor 1.G2 (At5g56230), SRP54 signal recognition particle (At5g49500) of the signal recognition in the endoplasmic reticulum, SOS1 sodium proton exchanger (At2g01980) of the intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, and a Clathrin adaptor complex protein (At4g35410) were all differentially expressed in the spaceflight samples between ARG1 KO and WT cells. The endomembrane system, intracellular transport, and vesicle trafficking genes were also a large part of the WT physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment, although the individual representative genes differed from those engaged in the ARG1 KO cells. This finding reinforces the conclusion that these processes are sensitive to the reduced-gravity environment and that cells handle them differently depending on ARG1 availability. The importance of vesicle trafficking and intracellular transport has also been identified in ground studies that demonstrated mutants of a vacuolar membrane system genes exhibited agravitropic phenotypes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Kato et al., 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Surpin, 2014)</ref>. In addition, ground studies have shown that chemical treatments that disrupt gravitropism cause aberrant endomembrane morphologies, particularly of vacuoles, which underscores the link between the endomembrane system and gravitropism in plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Surpin et al., 2005)</ref>. If indeed ARG1 executes its role in the adaptation to spaceflight microgravity through the endomembrane system, then the link of the endomembrane system to gravity sensing in the specialized cells of the plant root could be extended to include undifferentiated cells as well. Connecting ARG1 to gravity perception in undifferentiated cells would imply a universal, cell-type independent tool for gravity sensing in plants.</p><p>Another group of genes in this category associate with gravitropism on the ground through auxin signaling and cell polarity. POL, a Protein phosphatase 2C family protein (At2g46920) and the GRAS family transcription factor SGR7 (SHOOT GRAVITROPISM 7-At4g37650) showed substantially diminished expression level in the ARG1 KO spaceflight transcriptome compared to WT cells. POL plays a role in establishing and maintaining the stem cell polarity and localization of auxin signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gagne et al., 2008)</ref>, and SRG7 is involved in radial organization of the root and shoot axial organs that are responsible for directing asymmetric cell division <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Koizumi et al., 2012)</ref>. The most prominent example of ARG1 engagement in establishing cell polarity occurs in root statocytes upon gravistimulation and is a basis for root gravitropism. In ground studies, ARG1 KO plants exhibit increased auxin accumulation in root tips, which then results in a strong defect in root gravitropism <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Sedbrook et al., 1998)</ref>. Although ARG1 protein is likely to play a role in enabling auxin redistribution in statocytes, ARG1's wide association with the endomembrane system and cytoskeleton suggests a more diverse role in gravity sensing in plants, which is actually well aligned with the concept that ARG1 might be important to undifferentiated cells. ARG1 might mediate gravity signal transduction in undifferentiated cells by promoting the folding, targeting, or degradation of gravitropic regulators in the vicinity of the cytoskeletal network. The observation that the genes related to the gravity sensing and signaling were compensated in the ARG1 KO cells suggests that alternative systems to the ARG1 exist and were required for successful spaceflight adaptation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5.">BRIC-16</head><p>This experiment is the second time that Arabidopsis cell cultures were sent into space. The first cell culture experiment was launched to the ISS in 2010 on STS131 (BRIC-16) <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Paul et al., 2012)</ref>. These two BRIC cell culture experiments were substantially different in many aspects. First, the cells used in BRIC-16 and BRIC-17 were of different ''ages'' before launch, as defined by the amount of time grown on solid media after being transferred from liquid culture. The BRIC-16 cells spent an additional week on solid media compared to the BRIC-17 cells. Second, the BRIC-17 cultures were freshly established, while the BRIC-16 culture had been established as a culture line for years. When the new mutant (ARG1 KO) cell line was created, we simultaneously created the comparable WT line to minimize physiological differences in the two BRIC-17 lines. And finally, besides the differences in the biological material, there were differences in the experimental profile of BRIC-17 as compared to BRIC-16: the space vehicle used to launch to the ISS, the mission profile, and the days spent in microgravity (Table <ref type="table">S9</ref>).</p><p>The spaceflight transcriptomes of the WT cells of BRIC-16 and BRIC-17 CEL had only one differentially expressed gene in common (At5g62710, a protein kinase). However, the general patterns of gene expression in both experiments suggest they held many of the same strategies of physiological adaptation in common. In BRIC-16, although the largest category of genes induced were heat-shock genes, among the next most highly differentially expressed genes were those associated with pathogen response, wounding, and cell wall remodeling; a pattern that is closely aligned with the current study <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Paul et al., 2012)</ref>. The WT cells used in both experiments were of identical genotype; thus the most likely explanation for the paucity of coordinately expressed genes between the two spaceflight experiments is that each cell line began their respective flights with a ground transcriptome profile that reflected environmental and developmental parameters unique to each experiment. The BRIC-16 cells may have already engaged a series of adaptive strategies that were not necessary in the WT cells of BRIC-17; it is likely that the abundance of heat-shock and stress-response genes in the BRIC-16 spaceflight transcriptome pattern was related to a more stressful ground state before launch. Thus, the age and ''stress level'' of the cell lines before launch make a substantial difference in how the cells respond to the spaceflight environment. However, the</p><p>1108 ZUPANSKA ET AL.</p><p>very fact that they are different has provided valuable insight into the response that these cells-any cells-have to the novel environment of space. And yet, on this background, these cells also expressed and repressed the genes necessary to engage in cell-wall remodeling processes that now seem to be a hallmark of spaceflight physiological adaptation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>The results presented here suggest that there is more to understanding spaceflight adaptation than identifying genes that are changed in expression as WT cells adjust to spaceflight. There are also genes whose activity at certain levels is required for spaceflight adaptation but whose expression levels need not be changed from that which occurs on the ground. Those important but nonchanging genes are revealed by comparing expression patterns between WT and mutant lines. In a very real sense, limiting the list of genes required for spaceflight adaptation to those that need to be changed only in WT cells can restrict insight into the full scope of the spaceflight physiological adaptation process.</p><p>The Arg1 gene appears to have a major role in spaceflight adaptation of cultured cells, perhaps through gravity sensing, in these nonspecialized, undifferentiated cells. The major ARG1 role seems to relate to its association with the endomembrane system, mediation of the proper localization/targeting or activity of proteins at the plasma membrane or at organelles of the secretory pathway. These data imply that Arg1 also has a function in spaceflight adaptation in differentiated cells within intact plants. Moreover, these data suggest that the genotype, and therefore the physiological state of a cell, can have a dramatic effect on the expression profile of genes needed for spaceflight adaptation.</p><p>These data also further reinforce the conclusions drawn from a growing body of plant spaceflight literature that suggest that at least one underlying theme of the physiological adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment is cell-wall remodeling.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>FIG.2.

We would like to acknowledge <rs type="person">Lisa David</rs> for technical assistance and <rs type="person">Lawrence Rasmussen</rs> for preflight technical help with the tissue culture cell lines that were used in the BRIC-17 CEL experiment.</p><p>The authors also wish to acknowledge the large and various inputs from the community of scientists pushing the molecular biology frontiers of spaceflight science. That community includes the reviewers of this manuscript, who helped the authors clarify complex issues of presentation and interpretation. In particular the authors appreciate the need and desire of the community (and this paper) to remain diligent in the description of experimental results as comparing spaceflight samples to ground control samples. Isolating the effects of microgravity from the general and combined effects of spaceflight would require the utilization of high-quality long-arm centrifuges on orbit. Therefore, the authors strive to specifically use the terms ''spaceflight'' and ''ground'' as the terms for the major experimental contrasts in this study.</p></div>
