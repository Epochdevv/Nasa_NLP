<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>N 6 -threonylcarbamoyl-adenosine (t6A) is one of the few RNA modifications that is universally present in life. This modification occurs at high frequency at position 37 of most tRNAs that decode ANN codons, and stabilizes cognate anticodon-codon interactions. Nearly all genetic studies of the t6A pathway have focused on single-celled organisms. In this study, we report the isolation of an extensive allelic series in the Drosophila ortholog of the core t6A biosynthesis factor Kae1. kae1 hemizygous larvae exhibit decreases in t6A that correlate with allele strength; however, we still detect substantial t6A-modified tRNAs even during the extended larval phase of null alleles. Nevertheless, complementation of Drosophila Kae1 and other t6A factors in corresponding yeast null mutants demonstrates that these metazoan genes execute t6A synthesis. Turning to the biological consequences of t6A loss, we characterize prominent kae1 melanotic masses and show that they are associated with lymph gland overgrowth and ectopic generation of lamellocytes. On the other hand, kae1 mutants exhibit other phenotypes that reflect insufficient tissue growth. Interestingly, whole-tissue and clonal analyses show that strongly mitotic tissues such as imaginal discs are exquisitely sensitive to loss of kae1, whereas nonproliferating tissues are less affected. Indeed, despite overt requirements of t6A for growth of many tissues, certain strong kae1 alleles achieve and sustain enlarged body size during their extended larval phase. Our studies highlight tissue-specific requirements of the t6A pathway in a metazoan context and provide insights into the diverse biological roles of this fundamental RNA modification during animal development and disease.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Beyond the four canonical ribonucleosides present in RNA, nearly all life forms bear an array of modified bases in various transcript populations. Over 100 chemical modifications have been documented, with dozens often present in individual species; the majority of distinct modified ribonucleosides occur on tRNA <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Machnicka et al. 2013)</ref>. Altogether, RNA modifications collectively play diverse roles in RNA quality control, secondary structure, transcript stability, translational efficiency, translational fidelity, and regulation of RNA-protein interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Gu et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hopper and Huang 2015)</ref> and can influence disease and cancer progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Grewal 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Kirchner and Ignatova 2015)</ref>.</p><p>While many post-transcriptional modifications of RNA are broadly conserved, only a few are universal across known life forms. One prominent example is N 6 -threonylcarbamoyladenosine (t6A), which is found at high frequency at position 37 of tRNAs that decode ANN codons <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Grosjean et al. 1995)</ref>. This modification was recognized decades ago, and it stabilizes cognate codon-anticodon interactions through a stacking interaction that stabilizes the weak interaction with the first codon base, which comprises a weak A-U pair <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Weissenbach and Grosjean 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Yarian et al. 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr">Agris 2008)</ref>. However, the enzymes that generate this modification remained elusive until relatively recently.</p><p>Based on the inference that all organisms harbor t6A-modified tRNAs <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Sprinzl and Vassilenko 2005)</ref>, bioinformatic isolation of universally conserved genes of unknown function <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Galperin and Koonin 2004</ref>) yielded a short list of candidate genes that first led to the identification of YrdC/Sua5 as a t6A pathway component <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(El Yacoubi et al. 2009)</ref>. Subsequently, members of the universal gene family Kae1/Qri7/YgjD were recognized to be essential for t6A biosynthesis, along with its partner proteins (in yeast) Pcc1 and Bud32 <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(El Yacoubi et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Srinivasan et al. 2011)</ref>. Of note, mutations in components of the Kae1, Pcc1, Bud32, and Cgi121 complex (collectively termed KEOPS) had been isolated some years earlier, via divergent approaches intended at identifying factors in telomere maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Downey et al. 2006</ref>) and splicing/transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006)</ref>. At the time, the molecular role of the KEOPS complex was obscure, but its deep conservation justified solving the atomic structures of the archaeal Kae1/Bud32 natural fusion protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hecker et al. 2008</ref>) and the entire eukaryotic KEOPS complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Mao et al. 2008)</ref>. These studies assigned Kae1 as an ASKHA-type ATPase, Bud32 as a kinase, and Pcc1 as a dimerization subunit, with Kae1 physically interacting with both Bud32 and Pcc1.</p><p>Only later, with the recognition that these genes are involved in t6A accumulation, did efforts become possible to reconstitute the biosynthesis of t6A-modified tRNA in vitro, using purified bacterial YrdC (Sua5) and YgjD (Kae1) and two bacterial-specific genes that cluster with YgjD, namely YjeE and YeaZ <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Deutsch et al. 2012)</ref>. Similarly, yeast Sua5 and KEOPS complex sufficed to generate t6A-modified tRNA in vitro <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Perrochia et al. 2013)</ref>. The proposed mechanism is that Sua5 converts bicarbonate and threonine via a series of intermediates into threonylcarbamoyladenylate, which is transferred to the active site of Kae1 within the KEOPS complex to modify tRNA position A37.</p><p>Notably, Kae1 is the only truly universally conserved component of KEOPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Galperin and Koonin 2004)</ref>, and eukaryotes contain a paralog of Kae1 termed Qri7 that is mitochondrially localized <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Huh et al. 2003)</ref>. The fact that no other KEOPS components localize to mitochondria led to a suspicion that Qri7 represents a primal core factor that does not require additional presumably accessory KEOPS components. Indeed, subcellular redirection of Qri7 to the cytoplasm rescued the slow growth phenotypes of all KEOPS members that are defective for t6A accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wan et al. 2013)</ref>. Moreover, in vitro synthesis of t6A-modified tRNA was reconstituted solely with purified Sua5, Qri7, and substrate tRNA, in the presence of threonine, bicarbonate, and ATP <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Wan et al. 2013)</ref>. Thus, Kae1/Qri7 is the central downstream enzyme in the generation of t6A-modified tRNA.</p><p>The assignment of core genes in the t6A pathway permits organismal phenotypes to be correlated with the absence of these modified tRNAs. Budding yeast t6A pathway mutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(El Yacoubi et al. 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Srinivasan et al. 2011)</ref> are very slow-growing, while the bacterial pathway (e.g., in Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli) is essential for viability and cell morphology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Arigoni et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Handford et al. 2009</ref>). These seemingly general defects befit loss of a fundamental RNA modification pathway, but do not lend insight into particular processes. Otherwise, mutants of KEOPS complex members in single-celled organisms have impact on telomere maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Downey et al. 2006)</ref>, transcription <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kisseleva-Romanova et al. 2006)</ref>, and genome stability <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Oberto et al. 2009)</ref>, although it remains unclear how directly the loss of t6A relates to these phenotypes.</p><p>However, certain phenotypes now seem to be directly related to the biochemical function of t6A in improving translational fidelity. Of note, yeast sua5 was originally isolated as a suppressor of cyc1 alleles harboring an aberrant upstream start codon (uORF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Hampsey et al. 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Na et al. 1992)</ref>, implicating Sua5 in start site selection; AUG is indeed recognized by a t6A-modified tRNA. Correspondingly, Sua5 affects various aspects of normal translation, as mutants exhibit increased leaky scanning through AUG, frameshifting, and nonsense suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Lin et al. 2010)</ref>. One prominent locus controlled via endogenous uORFs is the amino acid starvation-responsive transcription factor GCN4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hinnebusch 2005)</ref>. Indeed, not only does sua5 derepress GCN4, KEOPS mutants (kae1 and pcc1) induce a gene expression signature that is substantially enriched for Gcn4 targets <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Daugeron et al. 2011</ref>). These precedents suggest that it may be possible to make linkages between altered translation and organismal phenotypes, even for this "housekeeping" cellular activity.</p><p>To date, genetic analysis of t6A pathway components has mostly been limited to single cell organisms, such as microbes and yeast. One study on the Drosophila melanogaster Bud32/PRPK homolog utilized RNAi-mediated knockdowns to define growth related defects upon bud32 depletion, although biochemical evidence was not presented for an impact on t6A biogenesis in this condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ibar et al. 2013)</ref>. Interestingly, the growth defects were related to PI3K/TOR signaling, and could be partially restored by expression of activated S6-kinase <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ibar et al. 2013)</ref>.</p><p>In this study, we describe the isolation of a large allelic series of D. melanogaster kae1 mutants, ranging from weak hypomorphs, strong mutants, to null alleles. These present various growth-related defects, developmental delay, and melanotic tumors. We present extensive biochemical and genetic evidence that Drosophila kae1 and its partners are core factors in t6A biogenesis. Notably, our phenotypic analysis reveals substantial differences in the genetic requirements for t6A in proliferating versus nonproliferating tissues. In particular, analysis of mitotic tissues in full knockout and in clonal settings indicates an essential requirement for kae1, whereas various nonproliferating tissues can be maintained in the null state for weeks. Moreover, kae1 appears to act as a tumor suppressor in the larval hematopoietic tissue. These data highlight biological complexity in the requirements of a general regulatory factor, and the utility of the Drosophila model to further understand the roles of t6A modification during animal development and disease.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Isolation of the "Black Spot" complementation group</head><p>During efforts to isolate mutants in the 72D-F region, we conducted an F2 EMS mutagenesis screen against Df(3L) ED220, which deletes 324,210 bp of chromosome <ref type="bibr">3L:16,</ref><ref type="bibr">080,</ref><ref type="bibr">404,</ref><ref type="bibr">777 (see Materials and Methods)</ref>. We screened ∼7000 crosses of animals bearing mutagenized chromosomes to this deficiency, and recovered 64 lethals. Within this collection, we recognized numerous alleles for which hemizygous larvae bore characteristic melanotic masses, which we colloquially termed "Black Spot" mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). These mutants failed to complement each other, and they typically exhibited an extended larval period prior to lethality (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B-D</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Notably, while Drosophila larvae complete their larval stages around day 5 and commence pupation, some Black Spot mutants survive as larvae for up to 18 d. Systematic tests against all of the lethal alleles we obtained in this genomic interval revealed additional noncomplementing mutations. Many of these mutants lacked black spots or generated them with low frequency (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1B-D</ref>). Several of these alleles were able to develop to pupal stages or even into pharate adults as hemizygotes, suggesting they might represent hypomorphs. Overall, these eight alleles appear to represent an extensive allelic series.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Black Spot mutants affect the Drosophila ortholog of Kae1</head><p>To identify the gene mutated in Black Spot mutants, we used P-element mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Zhai et al. 2003)</ref> to narrow the region of interest within the deficiency (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). Coding exons from genes in the region were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from hemizygous mutant larvae and sequenced. We identified one locus (CG4933), the fly ortholog of Kae1, that harbored nonconservative changes in all eight alleles (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Subsequently, we identified two uncharacterized mutants in 72F-73A (l(3)72Fb[209] and l(3)72Fb [331], V Bedian, pers. comm. to FlyBase) that failed to complement Black Spot mutants. Sequencing showed that the l(3) 72Fb alleles exhibit missense and nonsense mutations in CG4933, respectively. Notably, while l(3)72Fb[209] mutates a residue in the ATP-binding pocket, none of the other point mutations directly affect any functionally characterized regions (e.g., other residues that bind ATP or metal ion, or Kae1 faces that bind its partner KEOPS proteins Pcc1 or Bud32, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). Finally, we found that PBac{WH}CG4933 [f01978], which carries a piggyBac insertion into the CG4933 5 ′ UTR (dos <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Santos et al. 2015)</ref>, also failed to complement Black Spot mutants. These observations strongly support that CG4933 corresponds to Black Spot. Consistent with this, qRT-PCR analysis of several independent point mutants showed moderate decreases in CG4933 transcripts, and these were undetectable in f01978 hemizygotes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2B</ref>,<ref type="figure">C</ref>).</p><p>To confirm that Black Spot phenotypes were functionally due to loss of CG4933, we generated untagged and GFP-  Functionally/structurally defined regions are highlighted, including the binding regions for Pcc1 and Bud32, and the ATP-and ion-binding regions. All Black Spot alleles recovered from our screen revealed that point mutations affected well-conserved residues. Notably, none of the mutations directly affects a known functional site, although a few mutations are in the vicinity of such regions. The noncomplementing allele l(3)72Fb <ref type="bibr">[331]</ref>, identified from a public stock collection, bears a nonsense mutation in kae1. Note that 1A2 and 1A19 induce the same coding change, even though these were isolated from different chromosomes in the screen. (B) qRT-PCR analysis of kae1 from various homozygous or hemizygous mutants. All of our point alleles maintain substantial levels of kae1 transcripts, although several of them are reduced by 20%-30%. The pBac insertion into the 5 ′ UTR of kae1, f[10978], appears to be a null allele as no transcript was detected.

Both CG4933 constructs rescued independent lethal hemizygotes (1A13 and f01978) to adult viability, and no melanotic masses were observed in rescued animals (e.g., Figs. 1E, 3 and other data not shown). In summary, we have isolated metazoan mutants of kae1, encoding a universal tRNA modification factor, representing the first extensive allelic series of a t6A pathway factor in any organism.</p><p>Decrease, but not elimination, of t6A-modified tRNAs in kae1 mutants Although Sua5/KEOPS genes are wellconserved across different domains of life, their involvement in t6A synthesis has not formally been demonstrated outside of unicellular models. We initially utilized primer extension assays to assess potential defects in the accumulation of t6A-modified tRNAs. As positive controls, we assayed RNAs isolated from wild-type yeast and sua5, kae1, and bud32 knockouts <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Srinivasan et al. 2011)</ref>. Extensions using an end-labeled primer specific for tRNA-Ile <ref type="bibr">[AAU]</ref> showed that t6A pathway mutants were specifically depleted of a stalled product at the normally modified position A37, whereas primer extension patterns for control tRNA-Val[UAC] were not substantially altered (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>). Similar assays of third instar larvae bearing various strong Drosophila kae1 alleles in trans to a deficiency also revealed alteration at A37 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3B</ref>). However, the loss of modified tRNAs in the total population were notably modest compared to the yeast mutants, since yeast kae1 mutants retain only a few percent of total t6A <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(El Yacoubi et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Srinivasan et al. 2011)</ref>; see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>.</p><p>Inspection of modENCODE data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Brown et al. 2014)</ref> shows that Drosophila kae1 is ubiquitously expressed but present at highest levels in ovaries and the early blastoderm embryo, indicating its strong maternal deposition.

Because of these considerations, we sought to extend the analysis of kae1 zygotic mutants as late as possible. Bearing in mind that normal Drosophila complete their larval stages by ∼5 d, we collected RNA from 12-d and 18-d kae1 mutant larvae. However, we did not observe further decreases in the level of t6A-modified tRNAs even at these extended timepoints (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>To provide a global assessment on the amount of t6Amodified tRNAs in kae1 mutants, we purified total tRNA, enzymatically hydrolyzed the tRNA to ribonucleosides, and analyzed these using liquid chromatography-coupled triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a dynamic MRM method <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Su et al. 2014)</ref>.

We cannot rule out that the remaining modified tRNAs are exceptionally stable. However, quantitative analysis did not reveal further decrease of t6A-modified tRNAs in kae1[f01978]/Df between 6-and 12-d larvae, suggesting that perdurance is not the major underlying cause of the remaining t6A. An alternate scenario is that they are contributed by the mitochondrial pool, which is presumably generated by the mitochondrial Kae1 paralog Qri7 (annotated as Drosophila CG14231). We note that Qri7 generates only a minute fraction of total t6A-modified tRNAs in yeast <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Srinivasan et al. 2011)</ref>, suggesting a potential difference between these eukaryotic species.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Drosophila Sua5/KEOPS genes complement corresponding yeast null mutants</head><p>Because the fly null mutants did not fully eliminate t6A, we sought supporting evidence on the role of Drosophila Kae1 in this pathway. Therefore, we conducted genetic replacement assays in a simpler heterologous host system, namely, in S. cerevisiae mutants in t6A pathway genes. As described, these are slow-growing but can be maintained in the null condition and are nearly completely deficient for t6A <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(El Yacoubi et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Srinivasan et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>To judge the overall relationship of the fly orthologs to their yeast counterparts, we tested for direct complementation of several yeast t6A mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3A</ref>) by their Drosophila orthologs. We cloned the open reading frames for Drosophila kae1, bud32, and sua5 into the yeast expression plasmid, pADH416. Because yeast mutants in these three genes grow very poorly <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Srinivasan et al. 2011)</ref>, we transformed the Drosophila expression constructs into the corresponding yeast heterozygous diploid mutants. As controls, the same diploids were transformed with plasmids expressing the yeast protein, and with an empty vector. The transformed diploids were sporulated and then dissected to yield haploid segregants. Haploids containing plasmids expressing the Drosophila or yeast protein, or the empty vector, were identified and then streaked to individual colonies on selective medium.</p><p>The results of growth after ∼66 h at 30°C are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A-C</ref>. Colony size is a sensitive measure of growth rate for yeast. Drosophila sua5, whose product generates the substrate for the KEOPS complex, yielded growth rescue that was comparable to its yeast ortholog (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4A</ref>). On the other hand, the two KEOPS components Drosophila kae1 and bud32 both conferred substantial rescue, as compared with vector control transformants, but growth was not as robust as with the cognate yeast factors (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4B</ref>,<ref type="figure">C</ref>). The relative degree of complementation was also apparent on the dissection plates on which the haploid spores germinated. Representative tetrads are shown in Supplemental Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> for the kae1 and bud32 heterozygotes. In both cases, colonies identified as containing the Drosophila gene were larger than colonies containing vector or no plasmid, but not as large as wild-type colonies.</p><p>As the rescues by individual fly KEOPS proteins were less robust than with the cognate yeast factors, we tested if their function could be improved by supplying multiple Drosophila factors. This proved to be the case. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4D</ref> shows a kae1 mutant expressing Drosophila Kae1 + Pcc1 (sector 1), Drosophila Kae1 + Bud32 (sector 2), or Drosophila Kae1 alone (sector 3). Coexpression with either Kae1 partner improved growth rescue. Similarly, coexpression of Drosophila Bud32 and Kae1 yielded enhanced rescue of yeast bud32 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>, sector 2), relative to Drosophila Bud32 alone (sector 3). Notably, expressing Drosophila Bud32 and Pcc1 together did not improve complementation of yeast bud32 relative to Bud32 alone (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4E</ref>, cf. sectors 1 and 3). This is consistent with the fact that Bud32 and Pcc1 do not interact directly in the complex, whereas both of them physically contact different faces of Kae1 in the KEOPS complex <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hecker et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mao et al. 2008</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rescue of t6A-modified tRNAs in yeast kae1 mutants by Drosophila KEOPS factors</head><p>We performed biochemical analysis of tRNA modification in mutant and rescued yeast. Primer extensions using a probe against tRNA-Ile[AAU] recapitulated strong loss in the A37 band in kae1 mutant yeast transformed with an empty vector, which was fully restored by the S. cerevisiae KAE1 expression construct (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>). Comparison with yeast transformed with various combinations of Drosophila KEOPS factors showed strong agreement between growth properties and accumulation of t6A. That is, we observed moderate rescue by fly kae1 alone, but much stronger improvement by including other members of the Drosophila KEOPS complex (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4F</ref>).</p><p>We extended the above analysis of individual tRNAs to the total tRNA population using LC-MS/MS. These assays were strongly correlated with the relative degree of rescue observed in primer extension analysis. In particular, this quantitative method allowed us to distinguish greater restoration of t6A by Drosophila kae1 + bud32, relative to kae1 + pcc1 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G</ref>). In particular, the rescue by Drosophila kae1 + bud32 was equivalent to the cognate rescue by yeast kae1. Finally, we note that LC-MS/MS analysis of yeast samples also detected cyclic t6A (ct6A). It has been reported that ct6A is formed by cyclization of t6A and was observed in diverse domains of life including yeast, but not in any vertebrates tested <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Miyauchi et al. 2013)</ref>. Consistent with this, we did not detect ct6A above background in the analysis of fly tRNAs (data not shown).</p><p>In the yeast profilings, trends in ct6A levels closely mirrored those of t6A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4G</ref>). ct6A levels were below the limit of detection in kae1 mutants, and rescued to similar relative levels as with t6A by the KEOPS expression constructs. However, ct6A peak areas were approximately fivefold smaller than corresponding levels of t6A. Despite efforts to minimize hydrolysis by conducting the analysis at neutral pH, it is possible that a portion of ct6A was hydrolyzed to t6A during sample preparation. In any case, these results clearly demonstrate the biochemical activity of Drosophila KEOPS genes including Kae1 in the biogenesis of N 6threonylcarbamoyladenosine-modified tRNAs. Since we did not detect ct6A in Drosophila samples, we will continue to generally refer to t6A in the remainder of this study.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>kae1 mutants exhibit aberrant hematopoietic development and activity</head><p>Having established the role of Drosophila Kae1 and its partners in t6A biosynthesis, we sought to examine the nature of developmental defects caused by absence of this tRNA modification pathway. We began with the analysis of the namesake "Black Spots," which resemble phenotypes associated with derangement in the development and/or deployment of the hematopoietic system <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Minakhina and Steward 2006)</ref>. Therefore, we investigated the status of the lymph gland as well as circulating blood cells in the hemolymph.</p><p>We first examined kae1[1A13]/Df(3L) ED220 larvae, which exhibit a strong molecular defect in t6A biogenesis (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>) and generate "black spots" with nearly complete penetrance (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>). The hemolymph of control TM6B sibling third instar larvae exhibit normal distributions of blood cells (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5A</ref>), primarily plasmatocytes (identifiable as ∼10 µM diameter cells) and more rare lamellocytes (40-50 µM diameter cells). In contrast, hemolymph smears of ∼10-d-old kae1 [1A13] hemizygous larvae showed increased density of blood cells, and in particular, massive overrepresentation of lamellocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5B</ref>). We also identified large circulating aggregates that resembled lymph gland fragments (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>), as well as apparent phalloidin-rich tumors that were packed with lamellocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5D</ref>). The latter could be melanized and were identifiable as "black spots," but they were not necessarily pigmented, suggesting they had not yet initiated the melanogenesis cascade.</p><p>Notably, lamellocyte overproduction is a frequent feature of other characterized mutants bearing melanotic masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Lemaitre et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Minakhina and Steward 2006)</ref>. Therefore, we analyzed the status of the Drosophila hematopoietic tissue, the lymph gland. The compact disposition of the anterior lobe in normal third instar lymph gland is shown in  (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5F</ref>,<ref type="figure">G</ref>). Often, we find that the anterior lobe was in the process of dispersing, or completely detached from the dorsal vessel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5H</ref>). This correlates with the observation of apparent lymph tissue in the circulatory system (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5C</ref>). We observed similar phenotypes with the hypomorphic combination kae1[1A2]/Df(3L)ED220, except that its hematopoietic alterations were weaker and/or slower to develop (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>). That is, defects were less robust at day 8 relative to day 10 larvae.</p><p>As mentioned, most kae1 mutants exhibit a vastly extended larval stage. Thus, we considered it plausible that the enlarged lymph tissues developed progressively over this aberrant larval period. To ask whether kae1 mutants exhibit defects during the normal course of larval development, we examined [1A2] (weak), [1A13] (strong), and [f10978] (null) kae1 hemizygotes at the second instar. We observed overrepresentation of lamellocytes in anterior lymph gland lobes in all genotypes, although [1A2] was not overgrown and [1A13] was only slightly enlarged relative to control (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5I-K</ref>). However, [f10978] exhibited both considerable overgrowth and ectopic commitment to lamellocyte fates (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5L</ref>). This is despite the fact that [f10978] develops modest frequencies of black spot compared with [1A13] (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), indicating that hematopoietic tumors can exist without melanization of nodules. We also note that [f10978] exhibit lymph gland overgrowth despite the comparably small size of these larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), indicating partial uncoupling of organism size and individual organ size.</p><p>To verify their status as "tumors," we stained second instar lymph glands for phospho-Histone H3 (pH3), a marker of mitotic cells. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5M</ref>,N shows that kae1[1A13]/Df mutants also show expansion of their posterior lobes, although not as robust as with the anterior lobe. Nevertheless, these tissues show clear increases in the frequency of anti-pH3-labeled cells, indicating that the expanded hematopoietic tissues are accounted for by increased cell division, as well as alteration in cell fate toward lamellocytes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Essential requirement for kae1 in imaginal discs but not throughout the larval CNS</head><p>A conspicuous aspect of the strong kae1 alleles were their nearly complete absence of imaginal discs.

We mounted larval brain-imaginal disc complexes from wildtype and two strong kae1 mutants for comparison (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A-C</ref>). Discs were completely absent in most larvae, or at best yielded tiny tissue rudiments that might potentially be discs, but cannot confidently be assigned to any particular disc identity. In contrast, the CNS was slightly smaller but remained present. Closer inspection revealed that the optic lobes were strongly reduced in size in kae1 mutants, whereas the ventral nerve cord (VNC) was less affected (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6A-C</ref>). Notably, the optic lobes are the main proliferating centers in the larval CNS, whereas the VNC is primarily composed of post-mitotic neurons.</p><p>We further examined the role of kae1 in proliferating tissues by generating negatively marked somatic clones in wing imaginal discs. In this system, both daughters of a mitotic recombination event are marked and remain distinguished as clones. The homozygous mutant clone is detected by loss of a marker (e.g., ubi-GFP) whereas its homozygous wild-type "twinspot" clone expresses the marker more intensely than the surrounding heterozygous tissue. Control FRT80 clones exhibit similar relative sizes to their twinspots (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6D</ref>,<ref type="figure">D ′</ref> ). In contrast, FRT80 kae1[1A13] clones were never recovered in imaginal discs, even though their twinspots were sizable (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6E</ref>,<ref type="figure">E ′</ref> ). We quantified the differences in clone/twinspot sizes in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6F</ref>. These data imply substantial growth and/or competitive disadvantage of cells lacking the t6A modification pathway, which must have been removed from development after only a few cell divisions at most. We note that somatic clones of kae1 should still have inherited at least some Kae1 protein, mRNA, and/or t6A-modified tRNAs, yet failed to survive. From this, we infer that perdurance is not a major cause for the ability of kae1 null zygotic mutants to survive for over two and a half weeks (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential requirements of kae1 in mitotic and nonproliferating larval tissues</head><p>The clonal analyses caused us to evaluate more carefully the extent to which different tissues were affected in kae1 mutants. It is clear that kae1-deficient cells exhibit growth defects in some contexts. Nevertheless, our original isolation of kae1 mutants as extremely long-lived larvae exhibiting hematopoietic expansion (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) indicates that many cells and tissues can not only survive, but seemingly thrive in the kae1 null state for weeks. For example, differentiated post-mitotic blood cells such as lamellocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Krzemien et al. 2010</ref>) are both overrepresented and actively functional in encapsulation during the extended larval phase of kae1 mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5D</ref>; Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>).</p><p>We surveyed other tissues that were maintained in kae1 mutant larvae, including the gut (Supplemental Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">5</ref>), salivary glands (Fig. <ref type="figure">7A-F</ref>), fat body, and somatic musculature (Fig. <ref type="figure">7G-I</ref>). For the most part, all of these tissues are dominantly or solely composed of nonproliferating cells during the larval stages. Therefore, these observations solidify the notion that mitotic cells are preferentially affected by loss of kae1. However, this does not mean that defects were lacking in these other larval tissues. Interestingly, quantitative analysis showed tissue-specific and allele-specific differences between their behavior. For example, even though kae1[1A13]/Df mutants maintain only marginally more t6A than kae1[f10978]/Df mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3C</ref>), we observed progressively smaller salivary glands in kae1 mutants with less t6A (Fig. <ref type="figure">7J</ref>). More strikingly, the size of salivary gland cells was mostly unaffected in [1A13] hemizygotes, whereas they were tiny by comparison in [f10978] hemizygotes (Fig. <ref type="figure">7K</ref>). Thus, the slight amount of t6A in a strongly hypomorphic kae1 condition can maintain salivary gland cell size, even though these glands evidently have fewer cells than normal, whereas the null condition compromises both cell and organ size in the salivary gland. In contrast, the absolute size of the body wall musculature is largely unaffected in kae1[1A13]/Df, and only slightly reduced in the kae1[f10978]/Df mutants (Fig. <ref type="figure">7L</ref>,<ref type="figure">M</ref>). Indeed, the small size of kae1 null larvae (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>) may be sufficient to explain the small size of its muscles, which are expected to scale to body size.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Distinct effects of depleting kae1 in mitotic and post-mitotic contexts of an individual tissue</head><p>Our extensive phenotypic analyses reveal strikingly distinct requirements for Kae1 in mitotic and nonproliferating larval tissues. To test for potentially distinct requirements for kae1 in mitotic and post-mitotic contexts within the same tissue, we turned to an RNAi approach. The developing eye is convenient for this purpose, as characterized drivers can be used to express transgenes in the undifferentiated, mitotic portion of the eye primordium (ey-Gal4) or in the post-mitotic photoreceptors (GMR-Gal4). Analysis of ey-Gal4 &gt; UAS-kae1-RNAi flies showed strongly malformed eyes, which were small and rough (Fig. <ref type="figure">7N</ref>,<ref type="figure">O</ref>). We obtained similar results with independent RNAi transgenes (data not shown). In contrast, GMR-Gal4 &gt; UAS-kae1-RNAi produced eyes that developed normally, with all transgenes tested (Fig. <ref type="figure">7P</ref>).</p><p>Cellular analysis demonstrated that depletion of kae1 using ey-Gal4 caused developmental defects. Compared to the normal size and differentiation status of normal third instar eye discs, stained for the photoreceptor marker Elav and cone cell marker Cut, ey-Gal4 &gt; UAS-kae1-RNAi discs exhibit rudimentary eye discs with disturbed patterning (Fig. <ref type="figure">7Q</ref>, <ref type="figure">R</ref>). On the other hand, knockdown with GMR-Gal4 did not affect larval eye development (data not shown). Therefore, kae1 is critically required in mitotic, but not in post-mitotic, eye cells. </p></div>

Subsequently, a knockdown study of the D. melanogaster Bud32/PRPK reported growth defects relating to defective TOR signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ibar et al. 2013</ref>). However, neither study assessed biochemical defects in t6A accumulation per se.

Moreover, we demonstrate substantial cross-species rescue by fly Kae1 (and its partners) in yeast kae1 mutants, both in terms of growth capacity and in recovery of t6A-modified tRNAs. While this work was in preparation, similar observations using the kae1 transposon insertion alleles were reported by the Glavic group <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rojas-Benitez et al. 2015)</ref>. Our findings corroborate and extend their results. Nevertheless, our detection of substantial t6A-modified tRNAs in Drosophila kae1 mutants was unexpected.</p><p>Previous characterization of yeast kae1 mutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(El Yacoubi et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Srinivasan et al. 2011</ref>), which we confirm here, showed nearly complete absence of t6A-modified tRNAs. This raises two general possibilities. First, it may be FIGURE 7. Differential requirements of kae1 in mitotic vs. nonproliferating tissues. Larval tissues were analyzed from kae1[1A13] and kae1 [f01978] hemizygotes, which fully lack imaginal discs (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">6</ref>). (A-I) Immunostaining of dissected tissues, using DAPI (blue) and phalloidin (red).

(J) Quantifications of salivary gland sizes (n = 10 all genotypes) and (K ) salivary gland cell sizes (n = 15 cells from the distal tip measured in each of eight glands, all genotypes). Although kae1 [1A13]/Df larvae exhibit severe defects in mitotic tissues, the overall salivary gland size and cell size are more modestly affected. The null allele kae1[f01978] is severely compromised in both aspects of the salivary gland. (L) Quantifications of VL1 muscle length and (M) VL2 muscle length. kae1[1A13]/Df larvae exhibit normal muscle sizes, while the null allele is only ∼40% reduced.

(N-P) Adult eyes bearing Gal4 driver alone (N) or expressing kae1-RNAi under control of ey-Gal4 (O) or GMR-Gal4 (P).

(Q,R) Third instar eye-antennal imaginal discs stained for DAPI, Cut (green, to label cone cells) and Elav (red, to label photoreceptors). Compared to the control disc (Q), depletion of kae1 using ey-Gal4 induces severely defective eye development. All scale bars, 200 μm. that t6A-modified tRNAs are exceptionally stable in Drosophila. In this scenario, even though we assayed timepoints going well past the established range of maternal effects (e.g., up to 18 d, or the equivalent of a week-old adult fly), those modified tRNAs that were maternally deposited or generated from maternal kae1 mRNA and/or protein persisted all that time. Alternatively, many species, including yeast and Drosophila, express a mitochondrial Kae1 paralog named Qri7. Although mitochondrially derived t6A appears to comprise a minute portion of the total pool in single-celled organisms, the situation might be different in a metazoan. For example, the substantial populations of nonproliferating tissues that tolerate deletion of kae1 include the larval musculature, which sustain larval locomotion in mutants for weeks. Therefore, the remaining t6A-modified tRNAs in kae1 null mutant larvae may potentially be contributed by the abundant mitochondria in muscles. In the future, characterization of a Drosophila Qri7 (CG14231) knockout would provide a useful comparison, especially to see if Qri7 loss preferentially affects tissues with exceptional needs for oxidative phosphorylation.</p></div>

These discrepancies highlight the utility of the allelic series in dissecting multiple requirements of essential housekeeping genes in regulating fundamental cellular processes in vivo. Future studies can continue to exploit these alleles to elucidate the biology of t6A modification. For example, it remains unclear what underlying causes provoke the dramatic hematopoietic responses in kae1 mutants, and our alleles provide unique means for querying this. Of note, substantial hematopoietic overgrowth is observed in both strong hypomorphs and the null condition, but only the former proceeds reliably toward generation of melanotic nodules.</p><p>The kae1 alleles we report should also be valuable for understanding the mechanism of t6A modification. Extensive structural studies delineate the Kae1 active site and binding surfaces with its partners Pcc1 and Bud32 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Hecker et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mao et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Wan et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Zhang et al. 2015)</ref>. Interestingly, only one of our many point mutations directly affects any of these functionally characterized regions (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A</ref>). This highlights the usage of a forward genetic screen to identify relevant mutations. This mutant collection can be utilized as a basis of structure-function studies to assess how these uncharacterized residues might affect formation of the KEOPS complex, productive t6A transfer, or potentially the specificity of substrate tRNA recognition.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Differential requirements of t6A in proliferating and nonproliferating cells</head><p>Studies of the biology of t6A modification pathway in metazoan systems are only in their infancy. The Glavic group reported foundational studies using transgenic RNAi against Drosophila Prpk/Bud32 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Ibar et al. 2013)</ref>, and their recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Rojas-Benitez et al. 2015)</ref> and our current study extend this to genuine kae1 mutants. There are general similarities between the phenotypes of fruit fly and unicellular organism mutants, in that these genes are lethal (as in bacteria) and exhibit substantially defective growth (as in yeast). Of course, one of the major opportunities specifically available in higher eukaryotes is to examine potential cell-and tissue-specific requirements. Here, we find evidence for differential requirements for kae1 in distinct cell types.</p><p>Quite noticeably, strong kae1 mutants completely lack imaginal discs. The progenitor populations of discs are set aside during embryonic development, and they proliferate extensively during larval stages to generate the tissues that will form the adult body plan during metamorphosis. Although we cannot precisely assess the timing of effective depletion of maternal stores of t6A-modifed tRNAs (i.e., that are directly deposited into the oocyte, or that are generated via maternally deposited kae1 mRNA and/or protein), our clonal studies demonstrate a timely impact on removal of the kae1 genomic locus. That is, even though there exists substantial likelihood of Kae1 and t6A-modified tRNAs inherited from the mother cell prior to mitotic recombination, kae1 mutant disc cells are quickly disadvantaged and rapidly removed during the course of normal development.</p><p>Overall, we note these kae1 phenotypes are strikingly similar to certain other Drosophila mutants. For example, we and others previously characterized mutants of the central E1 and E2 enzymes in the SUMO pathway (the heterodimeric pair Aos1/Uba2 and Ubc9, respectively), and these develop a range of defects that are strikingly similar to what we documented for kae1 mutants. Phenotypes common to loss of Kae1 and SUMO include extended larval phases before lethality, presence of melanotic tumors, and preferential defects in mitotic versus nonproliferating cells, as evidenced by their lack of imaginal discs while retaining diverse other larval tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kalamarz et al. 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Kanakousaki and Gibson 2012)</ref>. Similarly, a number of zygotic cell cycle mutants specifically abrogate development of imaginal discs while generally sparing other endoreplicated and post-mitotic larval tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Gatti and Baker 1989)</ref>. Altogether, these analyses highlight how mutations in seemingly "general" cellular regulators can reveal tissue-specific requirements. Moreover, they suggest that several fundamental regulatory pathways are preferentially required in highly mitotic tissues. Whether this simply indicates that diverse processes mutate to a common terminal zygotic phenotype, reflecting the distinct biology of mitotic and nonproliferating cells, or whether there are actually mechanistic links between t6A, SUMO, and the cell cycle, remains to be dissected in the future.</p></div>

Benzonase, bacterial alkaline phosphatase, butylated hydroxytolu-ene, acetonitrile, and buffer salts were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Coformycin was obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Phosphodiesterase I was purchased from Worthington. Tetrahydrouridine was purchased from Calbiochem. Water purified through a Milli-Q system (Millipore) was used throughout our studies. Sartorius Vivaspin 500-brand centrifugal filter units were used for dialysis and sample concentration.</p><p>Extraction and purification of Drosophila and yeast RNA Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol and then subjected to a twostep purification to obtain tRNA. First, a PureLink RNA Mini extraction kit (Life Technologies) was used to precipitate the ribosomal RNA in the sample. In the second step, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-HPLC) was performed using an Agilent Bio SEC-3 column with 10 mM ammonium acetate at pH 7 as the mobile phase. Neutral pH was selected to minimize hydrolysis of ct6A. tRNA and rRNA were collected as separate fractions, vacuum concentrated and reconstituted in water. tRNA concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy at 260 nm. In the yeast samples, the proportion of tRNA to ribosomal RNA was much higher so only SEC-HPLC fractionation was required to obtain pure tRNA for analysis.</p></div>

The reaction mixture was supplemented with MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 , and ZnCl 2 , each at a concentration of 0.1 mM. Nucleobase deaminase inhibitors coformycin and tetrahydrouridine were added at a concentration of 10 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL, respectively, and butylated hydroxytoluene (an antioxidant) was added at a concentration of 0.5 mM.

Mobile phase A was 5 mM ammonium acetate and mobile phase B was pure acetonitrile. Gradient elution started with 100% A for 1 min, increased to 10% B after 10 min, 40% after 14 min, 80% after 20 min and regeneration of starting conditions with 100% A for 5 additional minutes. The flow rate was 0.35 mL/min and the column temperature 35°C. The effluent from the column was directed through the DAD before entering the Agilent 6430 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The MS was operated in positive ion mode with the following parameters: electro-spray ionization (ESI-MS), fragmentor voltage (average) 80 V, cell accelerator voltage 2 V, N 2 -gas temperature 350°C, N 2gas flow 10 L/min, nebulizer 40 psi, capillary 3500 V. Modified nucleosides were identified based on having both the correct retention time and mass transition. Under our chromatography conditions, t6A eluted at 8.6 min while ct6A eluted at N-2-Deoxyadenosine was added to each sample as an internal standard.</p></div>

Peaks corresponding to detection of MRM transitions for the modified nucleosides were first normalized to the peak area of the internal standard ( 15 N-2deoxyadenosine) to account for inter-sample detection fluctuations, followed by a second normalization to the summed peak areas of the canonical nucleosides to account for the amount of injected RNA. The adjusted peak areas of the five samples were calculated as a percentage of the corresponding wild-type control sample.</p></div>

[1A13]/Df(3L)ED220 larvae exhibit melanotic nodules of various sizes; a particularly large one is labeled with an arrowhead ("BS"). (B-D) Complementation tests identified a collection of Black Spot mutants, only some of which actually generate melanotic masses with high penetrance (examples labeled with arrowheads). Normal (wt) animals complete their third instar larval stage by day ∼5, and proceed to ∼5 d of pupal development. Pupae containing pharate animals are visible by day ∼10, and they eclose shortly thereafter as adult flies. Wt animals are shown as a reference to the left of B and C. In contrast, many hemizygous Black Spot alleles are substantially developmentally delayed and maintain their larval phase until days 12 (C) to 16 (D), with some living mutants detected at day 18 (not shown). All of the larvae collected in this summary were mobile and thus alive. Hypomorphic mutants could pupate and even advance to the pharate stage; however, it is likely that some of the pupae shown at the latest days are deceased. See Supplemental Figure 1 for additional notes regarding the larval extended phase, lethal phase, and black spot penetrance at different ages in the different hemizygous mutants.
