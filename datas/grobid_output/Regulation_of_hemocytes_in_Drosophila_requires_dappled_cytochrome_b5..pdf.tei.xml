<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is melanotic tumors or nodules, which consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells, similar to granulomas. Our analyses of the melanotic mutant dappled have revealed a novel type of gene involved in blood cell regulation. The dappled gene is an essential gene that encodes cytochrome b5, a conserved hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways. Viable mutations of dappled cause melanotic nodules and hemocyte misregulation during both hematopoietic waves of development. The sexes are similarly affected, but hemocyte number is different in females and males of both mutants and wild type. Additionally, initial tests show that curcumin enhances the dappled melanotic phenotype and establish screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds as a route for analysis of cytochrome b5 function. Overall, dappled provides a tractable genetic model for cytochrome b5, which has been difficult to study in higher organisms.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Drosophila is well studied as a model of innate immunity in humans and has been instrumental in establishing principles of defense and gene signaling pathways that involve both immune induction and hematopoiesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007)</ref>. The Drosophila Toll pathway mediates the response to microbial infections, and humans were subsequently found to have a family of Toll receptors that also respond to infections. Other shared immune signaling pathways are the Imd (immune deficiency)/TNF1 (tumor necrosis factor 1), JNK (Jun kinase), and JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-STAT transcription factor) pathways. Activation of NFkB transcription factors, which regulate target genes such as cytokines and antimicrobial proteins, is a key shared feature <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Wang and Ligoxygakis 2006)</ref>. Like the signaling pathways, the cell and tissue components of the Drosophila and human immune systems are analogous <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Kimbrell and Beutler 2001)</ref>. In Drosophila, the hemocytes and the fat body mediate, respectively, the major cellular and humoral arms of the response. Hemocytes participate in immune signaling to the fat body, phagocytosis, damaged tissue surveillance, encapsulation of foreign intruders, and remodeling of cells during development and also respond to aberrant self-cells to form melanotic tumors/pseudotumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Babcock et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Brennan et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Gateff 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rizki and Rizki 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Tepass et al. 1994;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Vass and Nappi 2000)</ref>. The fat body, like the mammalian liver, produces abundant humoral response molecules, including antimicrobial peptides released into the hemolymph <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aggrawal and Silverman 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Drosophila produces three types of hemocytes: plasmatocytes, lamellocytes, and crystal cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Crozatier and Meister 2007)</ref>. Plasmatocytes account for *95% of total blood cells and most functions. In particular, plasmatocytes are responsible for the phagocytosis of microorganisms during an infection and apoptotic cells during development. Lamellocytes are produced only in response to parasites or by mutations that produce melanotic tumors. Crystal cells constitute *5% of total blood cells and are involved in melanization. As in vertebrates, Drosophila blood cells also have two developmental origins: one early in the embryonic head mesoderm and another during larval development in the lymph gland <ref type="bibr">(Evans et al. 2003)</ref>. Molecular cascades and factors regulating hematopoiesis are also shared with humans and involve many pathways, for example, Toll, JAK/STAT, Hedgehog, Notch, GATA, and Runx <ref type="bibr">(Evans and Banerjee 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Mandal et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>A major category of mutant hematopoietic phenotypes in Drosophila is that of melanotic tumors or nodules. Melanotic nodules may be in the hemocoel or associated with the lymph glands and consist of abnormal and overproliferated blood cells that are covered by lamellocytes and melanized, similar to the immune response to a parasitic wasp egg <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Luo et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Meister and Lagueux 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr">Minakhina and Steward 2006b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Stofanko et al. 2008)</ref>. Mutations in a variety of genes and genetic pathways have been found to produce this phenotype, such as JAK-STAT, which is also associated with blood cell overproliferation in humans, the Toll pathway, and Ras/MAPK <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Asha et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Li 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Minakhina and Steward 2006a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zettervall et al. 2004)</ref>. Some other genes with this mutant phenotype are air 8 , encoding ribosomal protein s6 <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Watson et al. 1992)</ref>; black pearl, encoding a DnaJ homolog <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Becker et al. 2001)</ref>; l(3)malignant blood neoplasm, encoding a protein with human cytokeratin homology <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gateff 1994)</ref>; yantar, encoding a conserved arginine-rich protein <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Sinenko et al. 2004)</ref>; and the Polycomb group gene multi sex combs <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Remillieux-Leschelle et al. 2002)</ref>. The melanotic tumor genes are an important category to identify and define in order to understand blood cell function and regulation.</p><p>In a P-element enhancer detector screen concentrating on immune-related tissues and phenotypes, we identified the melanotic tumor gene dappled (dpld) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rodriguez et al. 1996)</ref>. Enhancer detector expression of dappled was high in the fat body, oenocytes, ring gland, and gut. Lethal and viable mutations of dappled produced melanotic tumors, and lethal mutation was also associated with aberrant tissue morphology, for example, of the fat body and gut <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rodriguez et al. 1996)</ref>. A distinguishing feature of dappled mutants is consistent melanotic tumor formation, in contrast to other melanotic tumor mutants, which typically have low and variable rates. We now report identification of dappled as a member of the cytochrome b5 family. Cytochrome b5 is a conserved, ubiquitous, small hemoprotein that participates in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions and pathways, such as fatty acid desaturation, cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions, sterol metabolism, and conversion of methemoglobin <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Schenkman and Jansson 2003)</ref>. Cytochrome b5 is thus involved in processes such as metabolism of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds, maintenance of oxygen levels, and production of steroid hormones <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Locuson et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Miller 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Yamazaki and Shimada 2006)</ref>. Cytochrome b5 genetics in higher organisms has not been very amenable to study, and dappled provides a new avenue of approach for study of cytochrome b5 functions. In this report, we characterize the dappled mutant hemocyte phenotype and present the potential to study cytochrome b5 function by screening for compounds that affect the dappled hemocyte phenotype.</p></div>

The dappled mutants are the dpld MLB (97/16) and dpld EJL (142/2) strains of <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Rodriguez et al. (1996)</ref>. Experiments were performed using dpld MLB /dpld EJL transheterozygotes or dpld mutants hemizygous with Df(2R)ST1 (Bloomington Stock Center). The hemese-Gal4 strain is that of <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zettervall et al. (2004)</ref>. The UAS-dappled transgenic strain was made using the cDNA clone RE66521 from the Bloomington Drosophila Genome Project, which matched our splice product for dappled mRNA (see below). The insert of plasmid RE66521 was isolated using the EcoRI and BamHI restriction enzyme sites, ligated into the EcoRI and XbaI sites of the pUAST vector using BamHI/XbaI linkers, and transgenic strains made by Genetic Services, Inc. Insertion strains of UAS-dappled into chromosomes X, 2, and 3 were recovered. All stocks were raised on the Bloomington Stock Center food recipe in a 25°C incubator. For the curcumin-raised flies, the food, before cooling, was supplemented with 20 mg/ml curcumin (Sigma), and parents were placed onto the food for mating and egg laying. Compare with <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Gupta et al. (2009)</ref>, in which doses for mice were 5, 30, and 60 mg/kg orally, daily for 19 days, and note that at 100 mg/ml, flies had high lethality in addition to developmental delay.</p></div>

This 642 bp PCR fragment was subcloned using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's protocol. After blue/white screening to select the colony, PCR and sequencing were used to confirm the insert and determine orientation. Transcription used T7 polymerase and 32 P-labeled UTP and the Ambion Strip EZ kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The rp49 probe was made using Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref> The dappled locus. a Four P-element insertions in dappled/CG2140 produce mutations with a melanotic tumor phenotype (k09716, k00107, k14202, and 01857).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cytochrome b5, the Encoded Product of dappled</head><p>The original dappled alleles, dpld EJL and dpld MLB , result from the P-element insertions (P-lacW) in strains 142/2 (k14202) and 97/16 (k09716), respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rodriguez et al. 1996)</ref>. The dpld EJL allele is homozygous and hemizygous lethal, and dpld MLB is homozygous and hemizygous viable. Heteroallelic dpld EJL /dpld MLB is also viable and, like dpld EJL and dpld MLB homozygotes and hemizygotes, has melanotic tumors <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rodriguez et al. 1996)</ref>. In order to identify the gene associated with the melanotic tumor phenotype, we molecularly cloned and sequenced the dappled gene. We used the technique of plasmid rescue to isolate the genomic DNA flanking the k14202 and k09716 insertions. Sequencing of the flanking DNA and alignment to the genome placed both insertions into the 5 0 UTR of CG2140 <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Tweedie et al. 2009)</ref>, with k09716 46 bp farther upstream than k14202 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>In contrast to our results, genome annotation assigned dappled as CG1624 based on the position of the lethal P-element insertion 88/15 (k08815), which did not complement the 142/2 insertion <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Spradling et al. 1999)</ref>. We therefore investigated this discrepancy in the identification of dappled. The 5 0 and 3 0 flanking sequences for the k08815 insertion are 3 0 -AQ034113 and 5 0 -AQ025871. Alignment of these flanking sequences on the latest Drosophila genome sequence, however, places them 176,059 bp apart. There are several potential causes for this gap in the sequence: multiple insertions, an error in data reporting, or a large deletion. To test for the accuracy of the k08815 flanking sequence, primers were designed to (1) flank the 3 0 and 5 0 insertion sites of the k08815 transposon and (2) extend from a P-element end primer (pRsyII) into a flanking sequence. The resultant PCR fragments supported the published flanking sequences, as wild-type products were not observed in the mutant strain and both insertion sites were verified with the P-element end primer (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Finally, these PCR products were sequenced to provide confirmation of the flanking sequences. These results indicate that k08815 is not a simple insertion but is associated with additional disruption at its genomic position. We set out to differentiate between either multiple insertions or a large deletion by performing complementation tests with other lethal insertion strains in the region. Complementation tests confirmed that a large deletion accompanies the k08815 insertion (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Complementation and mapping also placed two more insertions, k00107 and 01857, into the 5 0 UTR and intron of CG2140/dappled, respectively (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>We tested these various dappled mutants for alterations in transcription, further confirming that the dappled phenotype results from an effect on CG2140, by performing Northern blot analysis using RNA from dappled mutants. This analysis showed a decrease in CG2140 transcript levels in the dappled mutants compared with the Oregon R controls (Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>). The dappled strains are hypomorphic, with the lethal alleles stronger. The lethal allele dpld EJL expresses approximately 10% of wild-type embryonic RNA levels, whereas the viable allele dpld MLB has *80% of wild-type adult RNA levels. Analysis of the transcripts by RT-PCR and sequencing showed one splice variant, with a single intron (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>). <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">1 2 3 4 5   1 2 3</ref> (a)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>(b)</head><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref> The dappled transcript levels are reduced in dappled mutants. Northern blot analysis of dappled transcripts shows reduced levels in mutants compared with wild type. Upper panels: Northern blots after probing with labeled dappled. Lower panels: control for loading of RNA in each lane by reprobing the blots with labeled rp49. a Adult total RNA from Oregon R (lane 1), dpld MLB /dpld EJL transheterozygotes (lane 2), and dpld MLB homozygotes (lane 3). b Embryonic total RNA from Oregon R (lane 1) and dpld 01857 homozygotes (lane 2); embryonic poly-A RNA from Oregon R (lane 4), and dpld EJL homozygotes (lane 5).

Embryos from the homozygous lethal strains dpld EJL and dpld 01857 were sorted via a Balancer chromosome expressing GFP (CyO, Kr-GFP), in order to select for the homozygous mutant embryos. Quantitation after correcting for loading using rp49 shows reduced levels of dappled RNA in all mutants. Compared with wild type, approximate levels are (a) 65% in lane 2 and 80% in lane 3; (b) 40% in lane 2 and 10% in lane 5</p><p>Based on sequence homology from our alignments and the Flybase Genome Annotation, Drosophila gene CG2140/dappled encodes a microsomal cytochrome b5 (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>; <ref type="url" target="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033189.html">http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0033189.html</ref>). Genome annotation has identified CG2140 as the only cytochrome b5 in Drosophila. One related Drosophila sequence has been identified, cytochrome b5-related (Cyt-b5-r; <ref type="url" target="http://flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000406.html">http://  flybase.org/reports/FBgn0000406.html</ref>). Cyt-b5-r has 436 residues (there are only 134 for Dappled and 135 for human cytochrome b5), and only 30 of the Cyt-b5-r residues are identical to the Dappled sequence. In a comparison of the dappled encoded amino acid sequence with a selection of other cytochrome b5 proteins from mammals and insects, Dappled has 45% identity with human cytochrome b5 and 76% identity with housefly cytochrome b5 (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref>). Overall, the selected mammals and insects have 32% identity. Cytochrome b5 is a highly conserved, ubiquitous family of small hemoproteins that participate in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions. These reactions are involved in many biological processes, such as conversion of methemoglobin, sterol metabolism, fatty acid desaturation, and cytochrome P450-catalyzed reactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Schenkman and Jansson 2003)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hemocyte Misregulation and Melanotic Nodule Formation in dappled Mutants</head><p>The dpld MLB insertion has made analysis possible, as in addition to producing consistent melanotic tumor formation, it is the only viable allele. Maintenance of dpld MLB homozygotes as a stock, however, was not feasible because of effects on fertility. Homozygous dpld MLB or transheterozygous dpld MLB /dpld EJL females and males produced few progeny, even when mated with wild-type flies (\5 progeny/ dappled parent), and mutant females laid few eggs (*50/female). It is unlikely that this fertility problem is due simply to physical obstruction in the abdomen, because flies with less obtrusive tumors (i.e., small tumors near the thorax) also show low fertility. To avoid the effects of accumulation of second site mutations by maintaining the dpld MLB chromosome over a balancer, all experiments were done on progeny from crosses that produced transheterozygotes or hemizygotes.</p><p>The development of the Gal4-UAS system <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Brand and Perrimon 1993)</ref> to include drivers for the hematopoietic system makes it more feasible to be able to investigate the blood cell phenotypes of mutant genes, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Kimbrell et al. (2002)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zettervall et al. (2004)</ref>. The hemese-Gal4 construct drives expression in blood cells of the plasmatocyte and lamellocyte classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Zettervall et al. 2004</ref>). Strains with hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP thus have the blood cells marked with GFP, enabling hemocyte counting and phenotype analysis in various genetic strains <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Zettervall et al. 2004</ref>). We used hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP to investigate the blood cells of dappled melanotic tumor mutants. In melanotic tumors of dpld EJL /dpld MLB ; hemese-Gal4 UAS-GFP larvae, all of the cells in the masses were found to fluoresce strongly for GFP (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). Cell counts of circulating plasmatocytes and lamellocytes showed large numbers of circulating lamellocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). Lamellocytes are not found in normal, healthy larvae, whereas in melanotic nodule mutants lamellocytes are abundant <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Crozatier and Meister 2007)</ref>. The dappled melanotic tumors are thus specifically designated as melanotic nodules, which consist of hemocytes, as opposed to melanizations, which are non-blood cell tissues that have melanized <ref type="bibr">(Minakhina and Steward 2006b)</ref>.</p><p>Mutant dappled larvae were categorized based on the relative size of the melanotic nodules. Larvae with small versus large melanotic nodules showed different numbers of circulating plasmatocytes and lamellocytes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>). Notably, lamellocytes are more prevalent in small tumors, whereas plasmatocytes are more abundant in large nodules. One possible interpretation of the higher number of lamellocytes in smaller nodules is that these nodules are still actively forming, and lamellocytes are still being recruited to the nodules. During normal larval development, the number of plasmatocytes typically increases two-to threefold from the early wandering (early) to the late wandering (late) stage of the third instar <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Crozatier and Meister 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zettervall et al. 2004</ref>). Plasmatocyte representation from early to late stage wandering was different for small and large tumors. Larvae with large tumors showed an increase from early to late stage, whereas larvae with small tumors did not (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">4</ref>), and this may also reflect the dynamic nature of dappled melanotic nodule formation.</p><p>Heterozygosity of dappled does not produce tumors, but it does have a dominant effect on blood cell number. The dappled heterozygotes (Bal/dpld) have a significantly higher number of plasmatocytes than wild-type larvae (?/?). This difference was confirmed by counting hemocytes of dappled heterozygotes (dpld/?) and their control siblings (Bal/?) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). Further, counts of siblings showed that the increase in plasmatocytes is present both early and late in the third instar. The relative numbers of lamellocytes in dappled heterozygotes is less clear, as the average was very low, many larvae had no lamellocytes, and the number did not increase from early to late stage (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">5</ref>). Thus, although the lamellocyte data are statistically significant (P \ 0.05), dappled heterozygosity at most yields a very weak induction of lamellocyte differentiation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rescue of Hemocyte Phenotype but Not Lethality by Wild-Type dappled in Blood Cells</head><p>We next asked if the dappled phenotype could be rescued by expressing wild-type dappled only in blood cells. We constructed a plasmid containing UAS-dpld, which was used to make transgenic strains with UAS-dpld in different chromosomal locations. The hemese-Gal4 was then used to drive UAS-dpld, and the rates of melanotic nodule formation were compared in dappled mutants and controls. In addition to hemocytes, hemese-Gal4 drives strong expression in the salivary glands, so a control salivary gland driver, sgs3-Gal4, was also used to drive UAS-dpld. To test for rescue of lethality by ubiquitous expression, the da-Gal4 driver (Pili-Floury et al. 2004) was used.</p><p>The dappled mutants with hemese-Gal4, but not sgs3-Gal4, driving UAS-dpld are rescued from the melanotic phenotype. Three different UAS-dpld insertions were tested with hemese-Gal4, and all showed similar rates of rescue (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Dissections were performed to determine if blood cell nodules might be forming but not melanizing. The dissections confirmed that blood cell nodule formation without accompanying melanization did not occur.</p><p>The dominant effect of heterozygous dappled on plasmatocyte number is also rescued by adding dappled expression to blood cells. Hemocyte counts of dappled heterozygotes with hemese-Gal4 driving UAS-dpld had, on average, reduced numbers of hemocytes, compared with control dappled heterozygotes (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). The number of lamellocytes in heterozygotes was also reduced on average, but with the small number and variability in lamellocytes, was not significantly different (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">6</ref>). These results do not necessarily rule out other tissues as important for the dappled mutant blood cell phenotypes, but rather emphasize that the level of dappled expression in the blood cells regulates number and differentiation.</p><p>Expression of wild-type dappled in blood cells did not rescue the mutant lethality. In contrast, ubiquitous expression of wild-type dappled completely rescued the mutant lethality, producing normal adults with no tumors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). These results are consistent with the aberrant tissue morphology of lethal dappled <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rodriguez et al. 1996)</ref> and establish the importance of dappled transcript levels for normal function in other tissues. The dappled nodules form early in larval development, which is more consistent with an increase of plasmatocytes from the first hematopoietic wave (embryonic origin) rather than the second hematopoietic wave (lymph gland origin at the end of the third instar). As noted above, plasmatocytes in dappled tumors express the hemese-Gal4 driver, which does not express in the lymph glands, further indicating an early developmental origin for these cells. Additionally, the lymph glands appear normal, at least at a gross level, and only one dappled enhancer trap expresses in the lymph glands <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rodriguez et al. 1996)</ref>. We analyzed 1 kb of the dappled upstream region for potential binding by blood cell, lymph gland, and other transcription factors using the Transfac database <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Wingender 2008)</ref> provided by Biobase Biological Databases (<ref type="url" target="http://www.biobase-international.com/index.php?id=home">http://www.biobase-international.com/index.php?id=home</ref>). Among the transcription factor binding sites are many that are predicted to be T cell factor/pan binding sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brunner et al. 1997)</ref>, consistent with blood cell expression, and tinman/Nkx2.5 binding sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Kimbrell et al. 2002)</ref>, suggesting lymph gland expression (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>).  We tested for dappled effects in both hematopoietic waves by counting plasmatocytes at a time in development when cells of both hematopoietic waves are present. Cells of the two waves were differentiated by (1) using hemese-Gal4 to drive UAS-GFP in cells from the first wave of development, so that first-wave cells fluoresced green, and (2) staining all hemocytes with monochlorobimane dye, so that the second-wave hemocytes fluoresced blue but not green. The developmental stage selected to have both sets of hemocytes was white prepupae, age 0-3 h postformation as white prepupae. These results show that heterozygosity of dappled increases the number of plasmatocytes from both hematopoietic waves (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>).</p><p>Mutation of dappled affects both sexes similarly, and our results show both sexes together <ref type="bibr">(Figs. 4,</ref><ref type="bibr">5,</ref><ref type="bibr">6)</ref>.

For the experiment depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>, we separated the sexes in order to demonstrate this finding and test for a sex difference in the second hematopoietic wave as well. The results are that in both wild type and dappled there is a significant difference between males and females in the number of hemocytes for both hematopoietic waves.</p><p>Curcumin Enhancement of the dappled Melanotic Phenotype Cytochrome b5 is widely studied for its effects on drug metabolism, and conversely, various drugs are investigated for alteration of cytochrome b5 levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(El-Lakkany et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Juvonen et al. 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Portoles et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Schenkman and Jansson 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Sheweita 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Yamaori et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Yamazaki et al. 2002)</ref>. We hypothesized that modulation of the dappled phenotype could be used as an in vivo assay for cytochrome b5 related effects of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds. We are therefore screening compounds with a known connection to cytochrome P450s and/ or anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties for enhancement or suppression of the dappled melanotic phenotype. Initial studies with aspirin and the corticosteroid dexamethasone are negative (data not shown), whereas curcumin, the active ingredient in the spice turmeric, has consistently shown an enhancement of the melanotic phenotype (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>; Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>). Adult dappled mutants that have been raised (egg to adult) on curcumin-supplemented food have an enhanced melanotic phenotype, showing more and/or larger melanotic tumors (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). The enhanced phenotype of the dappled mutants is already evident in the larval stages (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref>). Adult dappled heterozygotes, however, do not develop a melanotic phenotype when raised on curcumin (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). Since both the heterozygotes and heteroallelic mutants have some reduction in dappled transcript levels, the effects of curcumin may depend on the exact amount of cytochrome b5 protein that is produced. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We have identified dappled as a member of the conserved, ubiquitous cytochrome b5 family. The complexities of cytochrome b5 function, through its participation in electron transfer in multiple biochemical reactions, are reflected in the difficulties and limited study of its genetics in higher organisms. Characterizations in humans have shown that cytochrome b5 mutation causes methemoglobinemia, which interferes with the balance between hemoglobin and methemoglobin, thus affecting oxygenation and inflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Hegesh et al. 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Umbreit 2007)</ref>. Mutation of cytochrome b5 reductase also causes methemoglobinemia and is more common <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Davis et al. 2004)</ref>. In addition, one case of cytochrome b5 methemoglobinemia may also have been associated with hormonal defects <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Giordano et al. 1994)</ref>. With the exception of a porcine mutation associated with an altered androstenone level <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Lin et al. 2005)</ref>, cytochrome b5 mutations in other organisms have not been identified. In mice, cytochrome b5 deletion is also lethal, but experiments with a tissue-specific knockout have allowed liver function to be addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Finn et al. 2008)</ref>. With our studies of dappled, Drosophila now provides a tractable genetic model for the study of cytochrome b5 in blood cells and other tissues. Hemocytes are particularly sensitive to mutation of dappled and show that cytochrome b5 functions to produce normal differentiation and numbers of hemocytes. Mutation of one copy of dappled results in a significant increase in the number of circulating hemocytes, and mutation of both copies results in the formation of melanotic nodules. The formation of dappled melanotic nodules is a Class 2 reaction in the classification of <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Watson et al. (1991)</ref>, in which Class 2 represents alteration of immune cells and Class 1 represents normal immune cells responding to other cell types that are aberrant. The dominant effect on blood cell number emphasizes that wild-type levels of cytochrome b5 are needed for full normal functions. In humans, levels of cytochrome b5 have been implicated as important with respect to xenobiotic metabolism and health. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Kurian et al. (2007)</ref> hypothesized that functionally significant genetic variability in cytochrome b5 occurs in individuals without clinical symptoms. They investigated processing of hydroxylamines, which are oxidative products of arylamine drugs and environmental carcinogens, by the mutant cytochrome b5 of one heterozygous individual and found, in vitro, altered affinity for hydroxylamine substrates and dramatically reduced cytochrome b5 expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Kurian et al. 2007</ref>). Expression of wild-type dappled in hemocytes rescued both the increase in blood cell number and the formation of melanotic nodules. The driver used was hemese-Gal4, which is active in circulating plasmatocytes and sessile hemocytes, but not the lymph glands <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Markus et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">Zettervall et al. 2004</ref>). Interestingly, the sessile hemocytes are a newly discovered hematopoietic site and appear to be the main developmental origin of lamellocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Markus et al. 2009)</ref>. This site of expression may be the key factor in rescuing the dappled melanotic nodule phenotype. Rescue of the plasmatocyte increase in dappled heterozygotes is expected to result from the hemese-Gal4 expression in circulating blood cells of the first hematopoietic wave, both because of the age of the larvae (prerelease of lymph gland cells) and because hemese-Gal4 does not express in lymph glands. However, dappled also increased the number of hemocytes from the second hematopoietic wave. Hemocytes from both developmental origins, embryonic and lymph gland, require dappled in order to be produced in normal amounts. It is an interesting question as to whether the plasmatocyte increase in dappled mutants can be independently controlled in the first and second hematopoietic waves.</p><p>Does the increase in plasmatocytes indicate overproliferation or less apoptosis? Since dappled encodes a cytochrome b5, the obvious choice would be apoptosis rather than overproliferation. There are two problems with this choice: it is mitochondrial cytochrome b5 that is established in the canonical cytochrome C signaling apoptotic pathway, and the use of that pathway by Drosophila is controversial <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Kornbluth and White 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Means and Hays 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Oberst et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Ow et al. 2008)</ref>. Microsomal cytochrome b5, however, has also been suggested to be involved in cytochrome C mediated apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Davydov 2001)</ref>, and Drosophila may have its own version of apoptotic signaling that uses the dappled cytochrome b5. Further, blood cells are well described for their role in response to apoptotic cells, but the role of their own apoptosis in development and infection is not clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Bruckner et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Crozatier and Meister 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Lemaitre and Hoffmann 2007)</ref>.</p><p>The sensitivity of hemocytes (compared with other cell types) to dappled mutation may result from blood cell mitotic cell division continuing during development <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Crozatier and Meister 2007)</ref>. There are many potential mechanisms for dappled to affect overproliferation, especially given the increasingly complex functions of plasmatocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Charroux and Royet 2009)</ref>. One option consistent with cytochrome b5 function, and potentially the dappled effects on fertility, is that hormonal signaling of hematopoiesis is affected. In that case, however, rescue of the dappled blood cell phenotype would be predicted by adding back wild-type dappled expression in the steroid-producing ring gland <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gilbert 2004</ref>) rather than hemocytes. Alternatively, dappled expression could rescue a steroid-processing step in the hemocytes.</p><p>An intriguing option is that cytochrome b5 has a new, previously unidentified role in blood cell signaling pathways, for example, through JAK/Stat or JNK. More specifically, a candidate to mediate the effects of dappled is TNF-receptor associated factor 6 (Traf6), which is predicted from protein studies to interact with cytochrome b5 (Drosophila Interactions Database, <ref type="url" target="http://www.droidb.org">http://www.droidb.org</ref>). Among its activities, Traf6 is an upstream activator of nuclear factor-kappaB, and mutants are immune response defective <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cha et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Wu and Arron 2003)</ref>. Cytochrome b5 involvement with Traf6 is a testable hypothesis through analysis of genetic interaction between dappled and Traf6 mutants.</p><p>Our results with curcumin demonstrate that screening of endogenous and xenobiotic compounds for effects on the dappled phenotypes can be done as an in vivo approach for analysis of cytochrome b5. Curcumin is widely studied for its potential as a nutritional pharmaceutical <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Duvoix et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Jagetia and Aggarwal 2007)</ref>. Among its many activities, which are mainly anti-inflammatory and anticancer, curcumin inhibits cytochrome P450s, down-regulates NFkB, and affects apoptosis and the cell cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Alpers 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Appiah-Opong et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kwon et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Sa and Das 2008)</ref>. Curcumin enhanced the melanotic phenotype of dappled mutants. This effect of curcumin is consistent with NFkB involvement, but there are other alternatives, in particular, cytochrome P450 processing in the fat body.</p><p>Mutation of dappled showed similar effects in females and males, but an unexpected consequence of our studies is the finding that females and males differ significantly in the number of circulating blood cells. In humans, a difference between the sexes in the numbers of blood cell types is well established, but the effects are unclear <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Blum and Pabst 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Huppert et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Reichert et al. 1991)</ref>. In both humans and Drosophila, there are differences in the immune responses between the sexes that affect health <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dale et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Marriott and Huet-Hudson 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Shames 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Taylor and Kimbrell 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Ye et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Zandman-Goddard et al. 2007)</ref>, and the blood cell number differential may be part of mediating the immune response differences. Recently, Drosophila hemocytes have been shown to directly signal immune induction of the fat body, and a reduced number of hemocytes resulted in less immune induction <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Shia et al. 2009)</ref>. In Drosophila, the increase in hemocytes of dappled and females may result in higher immune induction, which may or may not provide a healthier condition. For example, human females typically have a more robust immune response but also a higher incidence of autoimmune disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dale et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Zandman-Goddard et al. 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Cytochrome b5 expression is critical for survival, and its importance to hemocytes and additional tissues is emphasized by the finding that ubiquitous, but not hemocyte, expression of wild-type dappled rescued lethality.

In all respects, genetic interaction and drug screens for suppressors and enhancers of dappled will be useful ways to discern the many roles of cytochrome b5 function.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Fig. 3</head><label>3</label><figDesc>Fig. 3 Cytochrome b5 sequences.
