<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Total-body irradiation (TBI) followed by transfer of bone marrow cells from donors is routinely performed in immunology research and can be used to manipulate differentiation and/or function of bone cells. However, exposure to high-dose radiation can result in irreversible osteopenia, and transfer of heterogeneous cell populations can complicate interpretation of results. The goal of this research was to establish an approach for reconstituting bone marrow using small numbers of purified donor-derived hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without negatively affecting bone metabolism. Gamma-irradiated (9 Gy) WBB6F1 mice were engrafted with bone marrow cells (5 3 10 6 cells) or purified HSCs (3,000 cells) obtained from GFP transgenic mice. In vivo analysis and in vitro differentiation assays performed two months later established that both methods were effective in reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment with donor-derived cells. We confirmed these findings by engrafting C57Bl/6 (B6) mice with bone marrow cells or purified HSCs from CD45.1 B6 congenic mice. We next performed adoptive transfer of purified HSCs (750 cells) into WBB6F1 and radiosensitive Kit W/W-v mice and evaluated the skeleton two months later. Minimal differences were observed between controls and WBB6F1-engrafted mice that received fractionated doses of 2 3 5 Gy. Kit w/wv mice lost weight and became osteopenic after 2 3 5 Gy irradiations but these abnormalities were negligible after 5 Gy irradiation. Importantly, adoptive transfer of wild-type cells into Kit w/wv mice restored normal Kit expression in bone marrow. Together, these findings provide strong evidence for efficient engraftment with purified HSCs after lethal TBI with minimal collateral damage to bone. This approach will be useful for investigating mechanisms by which hematopoietic lineage cells regulate bone metabolism.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in bone marrow are among the most radiosensitive cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>. Lethal total-body irradiation (TBI) reduces HSCs to levels insufficient to support immune function and, without intervention, leads to irreversible acute radiation syndrome (ARS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref>. Adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from a donor into an irradiated recipient is an effective cell-based intervention for ARS resulting from lethal TBI <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4)</ref>. The ability of engrafted donor cells to repopulate bone marrow after lethal TBI has been routinely exploited as a powerful research tool in immunology and is used for investigating survival, differentiation, maturation and function of immune cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>.</p><p>Bone marrow cell engraftment after TBI has also been used in skeletal biology, most commonly in the subfield of osteoimmunology. As one example, studies leading to improved understanding of the genetic and molecular basis for osteopetrosis, a disease in which defects in differentiation of osteoclasts from hematopoietic lineage precursors lead to poor bone quality, utilized adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from wild-type (WT) mice into mice with inherited osteopetrosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. These studies clarified the genetic basis for the disease, demonstrating the utility of the approach. However, there are significant barriers to widespread application of this technique in the field of skeletal biology.</p><p>Ideally, adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from a normal animal into an irradiated animal, in addition to restoring immune function, would maintain normal bone turnover, growth, architecture, mass and biomechanical competence. However, these goals have proven difficult to achieve; high doses of ionizing radiation negatively influence bone cell differentiation and bone cell activity resulting in suppression of skeletal growth in subadult animals and bone loss in adult animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Therefore, radiation-induced alterations in bone complicate interpretation of results in studies using adoptive transfer.</p><p>ARS in mice induced by acute sub-lethal ionizing radiation is followed by gradual spontaneous recovery of the immune system <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. However, as with lethal TBI, there is suppression of bone accrual as well as accelerated agerelated cancellous bone loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. Alterations in bone cell number occur in normal growing female mice within 24 h of exposure to sub-lethal c radiation and cancellous osteopenia becomes apparent within two weeks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</p><p>After lethal TBI, engraftment with unsorted bone marrow was effective in reconstituting host B cells, CD8 T cells and CD4 T cells in spleen and osteoclast precursors in bone marrow with donor-derived cells but was less effective in reconstituting mesenchymal lineage cells in bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Since osteoblasts originate from mesenchymal progenitors, it is possible that failure to restore normal bone mass and architecture after TBI was due to a deficiency in mesenchymal stem cells. However, this possibility is not supported by the observation that osteoblast-lined bone perimeter, mineralizing perimeter, mineral apposition rate and bone formation did not differ between irradiated and control mice nine weeks after TBI. While the possibility that bone microarchitecture would eventually return to normal cannot be ruled out, the high rate of cancellous bone turnover in young adult mice (;100% per month) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref> suggests that a defect in mechanosensing rather than an inability to form sufficient bone is responsible for failure to restore normal bone architecture in a timely manner after irradiation. Thus, donor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) may be unnecessary for successful survival after lethal TBI. However, rapid reconstitution of the mesenchymal cell component of the bone marrow from surviving host MSCs may be important to minimize bone loss.</p><p>Prior studies suggest that adoptive transfer of a relatively small number ( 5,000) of purified HSCs are sufficient for survival after lethal irradiation of normal mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. This underscores the efficacy of HSCs to engraft in bone marrow, their self-renewal capacity and their ability to reconstitute multi-lineage progenitors. The use of highly purified HSCs (instead of unsorted bone marrow cells that contain a heterogeneous mixture of stem cells, multi-potent progenitors, as well as mature blood cells) allows for a better-defined model system without potential confounding factors attributed to large numbers of non-HSCs. However, the impact of adoptive transfer of purified HSCs on the skeleton after lethal TBI is unknown and the value of this approach diminished if the procedure increases bone loss. We therefore performed a series of experiments to evaluate efficacy of adoptive transfer using purified HSCs on animal survival and on bone growth, mass, density, architecture and turnover after lethal TBI.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MATERIALS AND METHODS</head><p>Female C57BL/6-Tg(CAG-EGFP)1Osb/J (B6.GFP), C57Bl/6 (B6), WBB6F1/Jkit W/W-v (Kit W/W-v , compound heterzygote), WBB6F1 (wildtype control) and B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (CD45.1 B6) were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). In experiment 1, B6.GFP mice (H2 b haplotype) which constitutively express GFP in all tissues except erythrocytes and hair were used as bone marrow transplant donors. This allowed for quantitative tracking of donorderived GFP þ cells in bone marrow in transplant recipients. In experiment 2, we used a B6 congenic strain carrying CD45.1 leukocyte marker (CD45.1 B6) as transplant donors and B6 mice as transplant recipients. Expression of CD45.1 allowed for tracking donor hematopoietic lineage cells as recipient hematopoietic lineage cells express CD45.2 allele. WBB6F1 mice (H2 ja/b haplotype) were chosen as bone marrow transplant donors in experiments 3 and 4 and transplant recipients in experiments 1 and 3 because these mice serve as wild-type controls for Kit W/W-v mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17)</ref>. Kit W/W-v mice were chosen as transplant recipients in experiment 4 because these mice have defects in HSC differentiation and, as a result, are more radiosensitive than wild-type mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and because restoration of normal Kit gene expression after adoptive transfer of purified wildtype HSCs into Kit W/W-v mice would demonstrate proof of concept of the efficacy of the technique.</p><p>Mice were housed individually in a temperature-(21-238C) and light-(12:12 h light-dark schedule) controlled room for the duration of studies. Food (Teklad 8604; Harlant Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to all animals. Body weight was recorded weekly. The mice were maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and the Use of Laboratory Animals and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Oregon State University approved the experimental protocols.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>The purpose of experiment 1 was to compare the effects of transplantation of total bone marrow nucleated cells and purified HSCs on mouse survival, bone architecture and cellular indices of bone turnover. One-month-old female WBB6F1 mice were randomized by weight into one of three treatment groups (n ¼ 4/group): 1. Untreated control; 2. WBB6F1 recipients receiving B6.GFP bone marrow cells (B6.GFP BM ! WBB6F1); or 3. WBB6F1 recipients receiving purified B6.GFP HSCs (B6.GFP HSC ! WBB6F1). The WBB6F1 transplant recipients were lethally irradiated with a single dose of 9 Gy using a 60 Co irradiator source (Radiation Center, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon) and reconstituted with either 5 3 10 6 donor bone marrow cells or 3,000 purified HSCs by injection (200 ll) in the lateral tail vein. The mice were maintained for eight weeks after cell engraftment. To label mineralizing bone, mice were injected with calcein (15 mg/kg; Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO) 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice. For tissue collection, the animals were anesthetized using isoflurane and killed by cardiac exsanguination. Tibiae were removed, fixed for 24 h in 10% buffered formalin, and stored in 70% ethanol for dual energy absorptiometry (DXA), microcomputed tomography (lCT) and histomorphometric analyses. Bone marrow was flushed from femora using sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and made into single cell suspensions for flow cytometry and ex vivo cell differentiation. Mesenteric lymph nodes were collected for flow cytometry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 2</head><p>The purpose of experiment 2 was to verify the efficacy of bone marrow cells and purified HSCs in reconstituting bone marrow after lethal irradiation in a second mouse strain (B6) using an alternative approach (expression of CD45.1) for determining transplantation efficiency of donor cells. Two-month-old female B6 mice were randomized by weight into one of three treatment groups (n ¼ 4/ group): 1. untreated control; 2. B6 recipients receiving CD45.1 B6 bone marrow cells (CD45.1 B6 BM ! B6); or B6 recipients receiving purified CD45.1 B6 HSCs (CD45.1 B6 HSC ! B6). The B6 transplant recipients were lethally irradiated with a single 9 Gy dose using a 60 Co irradiator source (Radiation Center, Oregon State University) and reconstituted with either 5 3 10 6 donor bone marrow cells or 3,000 purified HSCs by injection (200 ll) in the lateral tail vein. The mice were maintained for eight weeks after cell engraftment. For tissue collection, the animals were anesthetized using isoflurane and killed by cardiac exsanguination. Bone marrow and spleens were collected and made into single cell suspension for flow cytometry analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 3</head><p>The purpose of experiment 3 was to comprehensively evaluate the skeletal response to adoptive transfer of HSCs. One-month-old female WBB6F1 mice were randomized by weight into one of two treatment groups: 1. untreated controls (n ¼ 6); or 2. WBB6F1 recipients receiving purified WBB6F1 HSCs (WBB6F1 HSC ! WBB6F1) (n ¼ 9). The transplant recipients received 5 Gy TBI ( 60 Co irradiator source) delivered twice within a 4-h fractionation period, for a total of 10 Gy and reconstituted with 750 purified HSC by injection (200 ll) in the lateral tail vein. The mice were maintained for eight weeks after cell engraftment. As in experiment 1, the mice in experiment 3 were injected with calcein 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice and after sacrifice, tibiae were removed, fixed for 24 h in 10% buffered formalin and stored in 70% ethanol for DXA, lCT and histomorphometric analyses. In addition, whole blood was collected for serum separation, abdominal white adipose tissue as well as uteri were removed and weighed and bone marrow was collected from femora and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for gene expression analyses.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 4</head><p>The purpose of experiment 4 was to evaluate the feasibility of using adoptive transfer of purified WBB6F1 HSCs to restore normal Kit expression levels in bone marrow of Kit W/W-v mice. The study was performed as described for experiment 3, with the following differences: 1. The transplant recipients were Kit W/W-v mice; and 2. The mice were irradiated with 5 Gy delivered either once or twice (within a 4-h interval) prior to reconstitution with 750 purified WBB6F1 HSCs. We tested a lower dose of radiation in this experiment because Kit W/W-v mice are radiosensitive.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Whole Bone Marrow and HSC Transplantation</head><p>Bone marrow was flushed from femora of donor mice using sterile PBS, made into a single cell suspension, and red blood cells (RBCs) were removed by incubating with RBC lysis buffer (150 mM NH 4 Cl, 1 mM KHCO 3 , 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2). For whole bone marrow transplantation, bone marrow cells were washed and resuspended in PBS to 2.5 3 10 7 cells/ml, and 200 ll (5 3 10 6 cells) were injected via tail vein into irradiated recipient mice. HSC isolation was performed as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(19)</ref>. Briefly, lineage-negative (lin À ) cells were enriched from bone marrow cells using MACS lineage cell depletion kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA), where mature lineage-defined immune cells, including T cells, B cells, NK cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, granulocytes and erythroid cells, were removed from the bone marrow cell preparation. Enriched lin -bone marrow cells were incubated with anti-CD117 (c-kit) and anti-Sca-1 antibodies (eBiosciencee Inc., San Diego, CA). HSCs (defined as Lin À Sca-1 þ c-Kit þ ) (20, 21) were purified from enriched lin -cells by single cell sorting using MoFloe XDP (Beckman Coultert, Indianapolis, IN) at the Oregon State University Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Facility (Corvallis, OR). Purified HSCs were resuspended in PBS, and 200 ll containing 3,000 donor HSCs (experiments 1 and 2) or 750 donor HSCs (experiments 3 and 4) were injected into the lateral tail vein of each irradiated recipient mouse.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Flow Cytometry</head><p>In experiment 1, the percentage of GFP þ B and T cells in mesenteric lymph nodes was measured by flow cytometry using B-cell-specific (CD19) and T-cell-specific (CD3) antibodies. The percentage of GFP þ bone marrow cells and HSCs in recipient mice was also determined. In experiment 2, the percentage of donor-derived (CD45.1 þ ) T and B cells in spleens were determined using a combination CD45.1specific, as well as B-cell-and T-cell-specific antibodies. The percentage of CD45.1 þ bone marrow cells in recipient mice was also determined using CD45.1 congenic marker. All antibodies were purchased from eBioscience (Thermo Fisher Scientifice Inc., Waltham, MA). Data were acquired using FACSCalibure (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), and data analyses were done using Summit software (DakoCytomation, Fort Collins, CO).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ex Vivo Differentiation of Bone Marrow-Derived Osteoclasts and Adipocytes</head><p>For osteoclast differentiation, bone marrow cells from transplant recipients were cultured in osteoclast differentiation media [Alpha MEM media containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 ng/ml MCSF, 50 ng/ml RANKL] ( <ref type="formula">22</ref>), and adherent multinucleated osteoclasts were analyzed on day 7. Cytokines were purchased from Peprotecht (Rocky Hill, NJ). Cells were fixed in formalin and analyzed for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and GFP expression. TRAP in osteoclasts was stained using TRAP staining kit (Kamiya Biomedical Co., Seattle, WA). Rabbit anti-GFP Alexa Fluort 488 antibody (Molecular Probest, Eugene, OR) was used to amplify GFP fluorescence. DAPI was used as a nuclear counterstain. Cell images were analyzed using Olympus IX71 fluorescent microscope (Olympust, Waltham, MA). For adipocyte differentiation, adherent bone marrow cells were cultured in Alpha MEM media containing 10% FBS. After 5 days, adherent cells were cultured in adipocyte differentiation media (Alpha MEM media containing 10% FBS, 10 lM dexamethasone, 0.5 lM IBMX and 10 ng/ml insulin) for an additional 10-14 days. Adipocytes were fixed in formalin, stained with Oil Red, followed by GFP and DAPI staining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Densitometry</head><p>Immediately prior to sacrifice, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane delivered in oxygen and percentage body fat (%), total body bone area (cm 2 ), bone mineral content (g) and bone mineral density (g/cm 2 ) were measured using DXA (PIXImus 2; Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI). Bone area, bone mineral content and bone mineral density were also measured in individual tibiae after excision from the body.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microcomputed Tomography</head><p>Microcomputed tomography (lCT) was used for 3-dimensional (3D) evaluation of bone volume and architecture. Tibiae were scanned using a Scanco CT40 scanner (ScancoMedical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 3 12 3 12 lm (55 kV p X-ray voltage, 145 lA intensity and 200 ms integration time). The threshold value for evaluation was determined empirically and set at 245 (gray scale, 0-1,000). Entire tibia (cancellous þ cortical bone) was evaluated followed by evaluation of cortical bone at the mid-shaft and cancellous bone in the proximal metaphysis. Filtering parameters sigma and support were set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. Voxels having a threshold !245 (0-1,000) were used to distinguish bone from non-bone. For the tibial midshaft, 20 slices (0.24 mm) of bone were evaluated and total cross-sectional tissue volume (cortical and marrow volume, mm 3 ), cortical volume (mm 3 ), marrow volume (mm 3 ), cortical thickness (lm) and polar moment of inertia (mm 4 , an index of bone strength in torsion) were measured. For the proximal tibial metaphysis, 40 slices (0.48 mm) of cancellous bone were measured, 45 slices (0.54 mm) distal to the growth plate/metaphysis boundary. Irregular manual contouring a few voxels interior to the endocortical surface was used to delineate cancellous from cortical bone. Direct cancellous bone measurements in the tibial metaphysis included cancellous bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume, %), trabecular thickness (lm), trabecular number (1/mm), trabecular spacing (lm) and connectivity density (1/mm 3 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histomorphometry</head><p>Proximal tibiae were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and xylene, and embedded undecalcified in modified methyl methacrylate as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. Coronal sections (4 lm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica 2065) and affixed to gel coated slides. One section per animal was stained for TRAP and counterstained with toluidine blue and used for cell-based measurements. A second section was left unstained for dynamic histomorphometry. Histomorphometric data were collected with a 203 objective using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics Inc., Atlanta, GA). The sampling site for the proximal tibial metaphysis was located 0.25-1.25 mm distal to the growth plate and 0.1 mm from cortical bone.</p><p>Cell-based measurements included osteoblast perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter, %), osteoclast perimeter (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %), marrow adiposity (adipocyte area/tissue area, %), adipocyte density (number of adipocytes/tissue area, number/ mm 2 ), and adipocyte size (lm 2 ). Osteoblasts, osteoclasts and adipocytes were identified as described elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. Fluorochrome-based measurements of bone formation included mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single label normalized to bone perimeter, %), mineral apposition rate (the mean distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise each double label divided by the 3-day interlabel interval, lm/day), and bone formation rate adjusted for bone perimeter (bone formation rate/bone perimeter, lm 2 /lm/year). All bone histomorphometric data are reported using standard 2D nomenclature <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experiment 1</head><p>In experiment 1 we compared the efficacy of adoptive transfer of unsorted bone marrow cells and purified HSCs from GFP-expressing donor mice on animal survival, hematopoietic lineage cell reconstitution, mesenchymal lineage cell reconstitution, and bone mass, architecture and cellular indices of bone turnover after exposure to 9 Gy. All irradiated transplant recipients had successful engraftment with 100% survival for the duration of the experiment. HSCs give rise to cells of both lymphoid and myeloid lineages, in which the lymphoid lineage is composed primarily of B and T lymphocytes. The efficiency of lymphoid reconstitution was evaluated by tracking donorderived GFP þ B and T cells in transplant recipients. As expected, GFP þ B and T cells were detected in mesenteric lymph nodes of the recipients (Fig. <ref type="figure">1A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>). The frequency of these cells did not differ between recipients receiving total bone marrow or HSCs. GFP þ cells were also readily detected in bone marrow; the frequency of GFP þ cells did not differ between recipients receiving total bone marrow or HSCs (Fig. <ref type="figure">1C</ref>).</p><p>The effects of treatment on reconstitution of the myeloid compartment in transplant recipients are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">2</ref>.

Osteoclasts differentiated using bone marrow from transplant recipients (unsorted bone marrow cells or HSCs) were all GFP þ (Fig. <ref type="figure">2A</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>Here we show that bone marrow was reconstituted in female mice after lethal TBI when the mice were engrafted with unsorted bone marrow cells or purified HSCs. Both methods of adoptive transfer were effective in reconstituting osteoclast precursors from donor cells but neither method successfully reconstituted bone marrow adipocyte precursors from donor cells and neither method prevented radiation-associated suppression of linear bone growth or reduction in bone volume. WBB6F1 mice engrafted with 750 HSCs after fractionated exposures (2 3 5 Gy) had near normal bone mass and microarchitecture eight weeks after engraftment. However, this dose reduced weight gain and induced osteopenia in radiosensitive Kit W/W-v mice.</p><p>Turner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> reported that sublethal 6 Gy TBI resulted in a rapid reduction in bone marrow cell density in female B6 mice, reaching a minimum value of 14% of normal 3 days postirradiation. Spontaneous, partial recovery of bone marrow cell density occurred by 14 days postirradiation. In a similar study performed in male B6 mice, Green et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref> reported that neither immune cell populations nor cancellous bone volume fraction returned to normal two months after sublethal 5 Gy gamma irradiation. In the current study, bone marrow cell density, bone turnover and most measured indices of cortical bone architecture and immune cell populations did not differ from nonirradiated control mice two months after lethal TBI in bone marrow-engrafted mice. Additionally, adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells resulted in quantitative replacement of host bone marrow hematopoietic cells with donor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. However, this intervention was ineffective in preventing radiation-induced suppression of tibial growth, or in preventing cancellous bone loss from the appendicular (tibia) and axial (lumbar vertebra) skeleton. Importantly, the skeletal response to adoptive transfer of purified HSCs and unsorted bone marrow cells was similar, alleviating the concern that osteopenia would be exaggerated in irradiated mice not receiving donor mesenchymal cells.</p><p>Exposure to high-dose ionizing radiation results in cortical as well as cancellous osteopenia in growing mice but the magnitude of response and cellular mechanisms differ between cortical and cancellous bone. Radiation slows cortical bone accrual, due to decreased longitudinal bone growth and decreased apposition of bone onto the periosteal surface, whereas it accelerates age-related cancellous bone loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13)</ref>. The latter is caused by an imbalance in bone turnover due to bone resorption exceeding bone formation, and can be dramatic in the femur metaphysis of young adult mice because turnover rates can exceed 100% per month <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</p><p>Osteoblasts are derived from MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>. Despite a normal osteoblast-lined bone perimeter after engraftment with unsorted bone marrow cells, host mesenchymal cells in bone marrow were only partially replaced by donor cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. This may be because MSCs are less radiosensitive than HSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29)</ref>. Alternatively, there is evidence that MSCs do not readily migrate to bone marrow after tail vein administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. In contrast to normal mice, Kit W/W-v mice are devoid of adipocytes in long bones and lumbar vertebrae, and adoptive transfer of bone marrow cells from WBB6F1 mice into Kit W/W-v mice does not result in fat infiltration into bone marrow <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. Thus, adoptive transfer of MSCs may be dispensable for both mouse survival and normalization of bone formation after lethal TBI. In support of this, engraftment with 3,000 purified HSCs was as effective as engraftment with 5 3 10 6 unsorted bone marrow cells in maintaining normal bone formation after lethal TBI in WBB6F1 and in B6 mice. Fat infiltration into bone marrow is a common side effect of high-dose TBI <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref>. In some studies, increased marrow adipose tissue was associated with one or more detrimental skeletal effects, including decreased bone formation, increased bone resorption and bone loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. However, causality was not established and not all studies report a  negative association between bone marrow adiposity and bone turnover balance. In the current studies, the trend for increased marrow adipocyte density in mice receiving lethal TBI did not result in reduced osteoblast-lined bone perimeter or bone formation after engraftment of unsorted bone marrow cells.</p><p>In the current study, osteoclasts generated in vitro using bone marrow of WBB6F1 mice obtained after adoptive transfer of either unsorted bone marrow or purified HSCs from GFP-expressing donor mice were uniformly GFP positive. We anticipated this finding because osteoclasts are members of the monocyte/macrophage lineage derived from HSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. In contrast, adipocytes differentiated from bone marrow from the same mice were GFP negative. Adipocytes are derived from MSCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref>. Based on these findings we conclude that: 1. Sufficient numbers of MSCs survive 9 Gy irradiation to maintain or increase marrow adipogenesis and osteoblastogenesis; and 2. Adoptive transfer of purified HSCs selectively reconstitutes hematopoietic lineage cells. This property could be used to great advantage in genetic studies directed at evaluating the signaling pathways by which hematopoietic cells regulate bone growth and turnover. As proof of concept, we demonstrated restoration of normal Kit gene expression in bone marrow of Kit W/W-v mice after engraftment with only 750 purified HSCs from WBB6F1 mice.</p><p>Sublethal ARS in mice is associated with transient increases in bone formation and bone resorption. Increases in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter and osteoclast-lined bone perimeter were noted within 1 day of TBI <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. Bone lining cells are post-mitotic osteoblast lineage cells located directly adjacent to inactive bone surfaces and are much more numerous than osteoblasts. Hormones and growth factors, such as parathyroid hormone, growth hormone and basic fibroblast growth factor, can quickly activate bone lining cells to express the osteoblast phenotype and generate bone matrix <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>. Osteoclast precursors, although derived from bone marrow HSCs, leave bone marrow and have a relatively long (days to weeks) lifespan in circulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37)</ref>. Whereas proliferating cells are highly sensitive to radiation, post-mitotic bone cells are resistant to radiation-induced cell death. Activation of bone lining cells and osteoclast formation from circulating osteoclast precursors represents post-mitotic cell differentiation. Therefore, proliferation would not be essential for the transient increase in osteoblast-lined perimeter and osteoclast-lined perimeter immediately after TBI <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39)</ref>.</p><p>Long-term maintenance of normal bone turnover requires continuous replacement of osteoblasts that become osteocytes or bone lining cells, or undergo apoptosis and osteoclasts that undergo apoptosis. Reconstitution of donor-derived GFP þ osteoclast precursors in bone marrow was apparent 9 weeks after engraftment with unsorted bone marrow cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>. The differentiation studies performed here confirm successful reconstitution of donor-derived osteoclast precursors after engraftment with unsorted bone marrow cells or purified HSCs.</p><p>At the gene level, there were only minor differences between control mice and mice receiving purified HSCs (WBB6F1 HSC ! WBB6F1) in expression levels of more than 300 genes in tibia related to osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation and function, adipogenesis and hematopoiesis. This finding provides additional evidence that after engraftment with B6 HSCs, the bone marrow environment in the engrafted animals resembles that of untreated WBB6F1 controls. Studies performed to optimize TBI prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice indicate that improved survival and reconstitution of hematopoietic cells is achieved using fractionated radiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. The current studies suggest that fractionating TBI also has a bone-sparing effect.</p><p>We did not investigate the effects of lethal TBI on bone metabolism in the absence of adoptive transfer of donor cells. Therefore, the precise contribution of donor HSCs to the skeletal radiation response is unknown. It would be difficult to interpret the results of an experiment in which radiation was delivered without follow-up treatment because bone metabolism is strongly influenced by nutritional status, and the initial indicator symptoms of ARS include reduced appetite and weight loss. Localized 20 Gy irradiation to the right distal femur and proximal tibia in rats has resulted in weight loss and cancellous bone loss in the irradiated as well as the contralateral limb, emphasizing the importance of indirect effects of radiation on bone health <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref>. For this reason, it may be necessary to reduce the radiation dose used to deplete hematopoietic cells in radiosensitive mice. In the current studies, when Kitdeficient Kit W/W-v mice, a radiosensitive strain <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43)</ref>, were inoculated with 750 HSCs, they survived 2 3 5 Gy exposures, but experienced reduced weight gain, osteopenia and lower serum osteocalcin levels compared to untreated mice. However, these negative effects were attenuated in Kit W/W-v mice after 5 Gy irradiation. Notably, adoptive transfer of purified HSCs after 5 Gy irradiation was as effective as 2 3 5 Gy irradiations in restoring Kit gene expression in bone marrow.</p><p>In summary, we describe an approach for reconstituting the hematopoietic compartment of bone marrow by engrafting purified HSCs after fractionated lethal TBI. This approach will be valuable for studies in skeletal biology because near normalization of bone marrow function is achieved with minimal TBI-induced collateral damage to bone mass and architecture.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>FIG. 1 .FIG. 2 .</head><label>12</label><figDesc>FIG. 1.
