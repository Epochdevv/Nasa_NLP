<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice are morbidly obese and exhibit low total bone mass and mild osteopetrosis. In order to disassociate the skeletal effects of leptin deficiency from those associated with morbid obesity, we evaluated bone mass, architecture, gene expression, and indices of bone turnover in wild type (WT) mice, ob/ob mice fed ad libitum (ob/ob), and ob/ob mice pair fed to WT mice (pair-fed ob/ob). Mice were maintained at 32°C (thermoneutral) from 6 to 18 weeks of age to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure. ob/ob mice were heavier, had more abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT), and were hyperglycemic compared to WT mice. Femur length, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density, and midshaft femur cortical thickness were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. Cancellous bone volume fraction was higher but indices of bone formation and resorption were lower in ob/ob compared to WT mice; reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice resulted in pathological retention of calcified cartilage. Pair-fed ob/ob mice were lighter, had lower WAT, uterine weight, and serum glucose than ob/ob mice. Similarly, femoral length, BMC, and cortical thickness were lower in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice, as were indices of cancellous bone formation and resorption. In contrast, bone marrow adiposity, calcified cartilage and cancellous bone volume fraction were higher at one or more cancellous sites in pair-fed ob/ob mice compared to ob/ob mice. These findings demonstrate that the skeletal abnormalities caused by leptin deficiency are markedly attenuated in morbidly obese ob/ob mice.</p></div>

Rodents deficient in leptin signaling, due to either an inability to generate leptin (ob/ob mice) or the signaling form of the leptin receptor (db/db mice and fa/fa rats), become morbidly obese <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Clement 2000)</ref>. Their excess weight is the result of a combination of hyperphagia and reduced thermogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hwa, et al. 1996)</ref>. In addition to morbid obesity, leptin deficiency is associated with hypogonadism <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Barkan, et al. 2005)</ref>, elevated corticosteroid levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Saito and Bray 1983)</ref>, and impaired thermoregulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Trayhurn and James 1978)</ref>.</p><p>Leptin-deficient mice and leptin receptor-deficient mice and rats have reduced overall bone mass, reduced longitudinal bone growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Kishida, et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Steppan, et al. 2000)</ref>, and decreased bone formation <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Gat-Yablonski and Phillip 2008)</ref>. In addition, impaired bone resorption in ob/ob and db/db mice results in mild osteopetrosis <ref type="bibr">(Turner, et al. 2013</ref>), a condition which may contribute to the reported reductions in bone quality observed in these animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ealey, et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kimura, et al. 2012)</ref>. Impaired bone resorption may also account for the age-and bone-dependent variation in cancellous bone volume observed in leptin signaling-deficient mice; the mutant mice are reported to have normal to increased cancellous bone volume fraction in lumbar vertebra and decreased to increased cancellous bone volume fraction in long bones <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Hamrick, et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Iwaniec, et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Williams, et al. 2011)</ref>. The skeletal abnormalities observed in mice and rats with defective leptin signaling suggest that leptin plays a role in normal skeletal growth, maturation, and turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bartell, et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Iwaniec et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Kishida et al. 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Steppan et al. 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turner et al. 2013</ref>). However, it is not clear to what extent the skeletal phenotype of ob/ob mice is impacted by additional factors associated with morbid obesity.</p><p>Although rare in humans, leptin signaling deficiency occurs as a result of loss of function mutations in the genes for leptin and the leptin receptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Friedman and Halaas 1998)</ref>. More common causes for low leptin signaling in humans include anorexia and starvation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dardeno, et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Muller, et al. 2009)</ref>. At the other end of the spectrum, diet-induced leptin resistance, associated with chronically elevated leptin levels, mimics many of the metabolic consequences of leptin deficiency on energy metabolism and is thought to contribute to development of morbid obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Jung and Kim 2013)</ref>. Thus, changes in leptin levels and/or leptin sensitivity could have physiological effects on bone metabolism.</p><p>In order to better understand the specific actions of leptin in regulating bone mass, density and architecture, we performed a study in which differences in body weight gain between rapidly growing wild type (WT) and ob/ob mice were prevented by housing all mice at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Trayhurn 1979</ref>) and pair-feeding the mutant mice to WT mice to equalize food intake.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental Design</head><p>The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Four-week-old female ob/ob (n=20) and homozygous WT (+/+) littermate (n=11) mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). At 6 weeks of age, all animals were transferred from normal room temperature (22°C) to thermoneutral temperature (32°C) and maintained at thermoneutrality on a 12-h light, 12-h dark cycle for the duration of study (12 weeks). Food (Teklad 8604, Harlen Labratories, Indianapolis, IN) and water were provided ad libitum to WT mice (n=11) and a group of ob/ob mice (n=10). A second group of ob/ob mice (n=10) was pair-fed to the WT mice; the ob/ob mice were fed an amount of food equivalent to the group mean for WT mice.</p><p>Food consumption was measured daily in WT mice and weekly in the ad libitum-fed ob/ob mice. Body weight was recorded weekly in all mice. The fluorochrome declomycin (20 mg/kg, Sigma, St Louis, MO) was administered at study initiation and the fluorochrome calcein (20 mg/kg, Sigma, St Louis, MO) was administered 4 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice to label mineralizing bone. All mice were fasted overnight. The mice were then anesthetized with 2-3% isofluorane delivered in oxygen, bled by cardiac puncture, and glucose measured using a glucometer (Life Scan Inc, Milpitas, CA). Serum was collected and stored at -80°C for measurement of global markers of bone turnover. Uteri and abdominal white adipose tissue (WAT) were excised and weighed. Femora and lumbar vertebrae were removed and stored in 70% ethanol for analysis using dual energy absorptiometry (DXA), microcomputed tomography (μCT), and histomorphometry. Tibiae were removed, cleaned of soft tissue, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80ºC for mRNA isolation and gene expression analysis.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Microcomputed Tomography</head><p>μCT was used for nondestructive three-dimensional evaluation of bone microarchitecture <ref type="bibr">(Bouxsein, et al. 2010)</ref>. Femora and lumbar vertebrae were scanned in 70% ethanol using a Scanco μCT40 scanner (Scanco Medical AG, Basserdorf, Switzerland) at a voxel size of 12 × 12 × 12 μm (55 kV p x-ray voltage, 145 μA intensity, and 200 ms integration time). Evaluations were conducted with filtering parameters sigma and support set to 0.8 and 1, respectively. Bone segmentation was performed at a threshold of 245 (scale, 0-1000) determined empirically. Total femur was evaluated followed by evaluation of cortical bone in the midshaft femur and cancellous bone in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis. Automated contouring was used to delineate cortical bone from non-bone. Following, all cortical slices were examined visually for potential inclusion of cancellous struts originating from the endocortex (extremely rare at this site) and manually removed when present. For cortical bone, 20 slices (0.24 mm) of bone were evaluated, and cross-sectional tissue volume (cortical and marrow volume, mm 3 ), cortical volume (mm 3 ), marrow volume (mm 3 ), and cortical thickness (μm) measured. Polar moment of inertia was determined as a surrogate measure of bone strength in torsion. Architectural parameters are expressed using standard 3-dimensional nomenclature. For the femoral metaphysis, 40 slices (480 μm) of cancellous bone were evaluated. The entire cancellous compartment was assessed in the femoral epiphysis. Analysis of lumbar vertebra included the entire region of cancellous bone between the cranial and caudal growth plates. Manual contouring was used to delineate cancellous from cortical bone in the femur metaphysis, femur epiphysis, and vertebral body. Cancellous bone measurements in femur and lumbar vertebra included bone volume fraction (bone volume/tissue volume, BV/TV, %), connectivity density (mm -3 ), trabecular number (mm -1 ), trabecular thickness (mm) and trabecular separation (mm) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Thomsen, et al. 2005)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Histomorphometry</head><p>The histological methods used here have been described in detail <ref type="bibr">(Iwaniec, et al. 2008)</ref>. In brief, the distal femur was dehydrated in graded series of ethanol and xylene and embedded undecalcified in modified methyl methacrylate. Sections (4 μm thick) were cut with a vertical bed microtome (Leica/Jung 2165) and affixed to slides precoated with a 1% gelatin solution. Sections were mounted unstained for measurement of fluorochrome labels. For cell-based measurements, sections were stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase and counterstained with toluidine blue (Sigma, St Louis). All data were collected using the OsteoMeasure System (OsteoMetrics, Inc., Atlanta, GA). The sampling site for the distal femoral metaphysis was located 0.25-1.25 mm proximal to the growth plate. The entire cancellous compartment was evaluated in the distal femoral epiphysis and body of lumbar vertebra.</p><p>Fluorochrome-based measurements of bone formation included: (1) mineralizing perimeter (mineralizing perimeter/bone perimeter: cancellous bone perimeter covered with double plus half single label normalized to bone perimeter, %), (2) mineral apposition rate (the distance between two fluorochrome markers that comprise a double label divided by the 3 day interlabel interval, μm/day), and (3) bone formation rate (bone formation rate/bone perimeter: calculated by multiplying mineralizing perimeter by mineral apposition rate normalized to bone perimeter, μm 2 /μm/y).</p><p>Declomycin label retained in the regions of interest (mm label/mm 2 tissue area) in the distal femur epiphysis and lumbar vertebra was measured as a dynamic index of bone resorption in ob/ob and pair-fed ob/ob mice. This method is based on the principle that declomycin label was incorporated into bone at equivalent rates in both groups of ob/ob mice when the fluorochrome was administered prior to treatment initiation and differences measured at study termination reflect the effect of treatment on resorption of the fluorochrome-labeled bone. This method has been described <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Westerlind, et al. 1997</ref>). We did not measure declomycin label in WT mice because almost no label was retained in this group at termination of study.</p><p>Cell-based measurements included osteoblast perimeter, osteoclast perimeter, adipocyte number, and adipocyte area. Osteoblast perimeter was determined as a percentage of total bone perimeter lined by a palisade of plump cuboidal cells located immediately adjacent to the thin layer of osteoid in direct physical contact with the bone perimeter (osteoblast perimeter/bone perimeter, %). Osteoclast perimeter was determined as the percentage of cancellous bone perimeter covered by multinucleated (two or more nuclei) cells with acid phosphatase positive (red-stained) cytoplasm (osteoclast perimeter/bone perimeter, %). Cartilage area in the distal femur metaphysis and epiphysis was measured and expressed as % cancellous bone area. The intense metachromatic (purple) staining of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans with toluidine blue was used to identify cartilage within trabeculae. Adipocyte number and area were also measured and expressed as bone marrow adiposity (tissue area occupied by adipocytes: adipocyte area/tissue area, %), and adipocyte density (number of adipocytes/mm 2 ). Adipocytes were identified morphologically as large (&gt; 75 μm 2 ) circular or oval-shaped cells bordered by a prominent cell membrane and lacking cytoplasmic staining due to alcohol extraction of intracellular lipids during processing. This method was previously validated by fat extraction and analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Menagh, et al. 2010)</ref>. All histomorphometric data are expressed using standard 2-dimensional nomenclature <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Dempster, et al. 2013)</ref> to distinguish 2-dimensional histomorphometric measurements from 3-dimensional μCT measurements.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gene Expression</head><p>Tibiae were pulverized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen and then further homogenized in Trizol (Invitrogen; Valencia, CA). Total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol, and mRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis SuperMix for qRT-PCR (Invitrogen). The expression of 84 genes related to osteogenic differentiation was determined using the Mouse Osteogenesis RT 2 Profiler™ PCR Array (Qiagen; Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene expression was normalized to GAPDH and relative quantification was determined using the ΔΔCt method using RT 2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis software version 3.5 (Qiagen).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistics</head><p>Mean responses of individual variables were compared between the WT, ob/ob, and pair-fed ob/ob groups using separate one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Tukey's procedure for pairwise multiple comparisons. The required conditions for valid use of ANOVA models were assessed using Levene's test for homogeneity of variance, plots of residuals versus fitted values, normal quantile plots, and the Anderson-Darling test of normality. A modified F test was used when the assumption of equal variance was violated, with Welch's two-sample t-test used for pairwise comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Welch 1951)</ref>. The Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test was used when only the normality assumption was violated, in which case the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used for pairwise comparisons. Longitudinal data on body weight were analyzed using a random intercept linear mixed model that allowed distinct linear rates of change for the WT and pair-fed ob/ob groups and a quadratic time trend for the ob/ob group. The Hommel method for maintaining the familywise error rate at 5% was used to adjust for multiple comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hommel 1988)</ref>. Data analysis was performed using R version 2.12. Gene expression analysis was performed using RT 2 Profiler PCR Array Data Analysis version 3.5 (Qiagen). Gene expression is reported as mean fold change. All other data are reported as mean ± SE.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Results</head><p>The effects of pair feeding (to match food intake in WT mice) on body weight and cumulative food intake, and on abdominal WAT weight, blood glucose levels, uterine weight, and serum osteocalcin and CTx levels at sacrifice in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice housed at thermoneutral temperature are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. Six-week-old ob/ob mice were heavier than their age-matched WT littermates at start of treatment and gained more weight than the WT mice during the 12-week study (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref> and <ref type="figure">B</ref>). ob/ob mice were hyperphagic consuming, on average, twice as much food as WT mice (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>). At termination of study, the ob/ob mice had more abdominal WAT (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1D</ref>), and were hyperglycemic (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>) and hypogonadal (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1F</ref>) compared to WT mice.</p><p>Pair-fed ob/ob mice had lower body weight and body weight gain, lower cumulative food intake, lower abdominal WAT weight, lower blood glucose levels, and slightly lower uterine weight than ob/ob mice. Pair-feeding abolished differences in weight gain and blood glucose levels between WT and ob/ob mice. However, the pair-fed ob/ob mice were still heavier, had more WAT, and were hypogonadal compared to WT mice.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Discussion</head><p>We investigated the contribution of excessive weight gain to the skeletal phenotype of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Mice were housed at 32°C and a group of ob/ob mice was pair-fed to WT mice. Housing mice at 32°C, which is within the thermoneutral range for WT and ob/ob mice, was expected to minimize differences in resting energy expenditure and pair feeding ob/ob mice to WT mice was expected to equalize energy intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Knehans and Romsos 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rafael and Herling 2000)</ref>. The parallel increase in body weight gain in WT mice and ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice over the 12-week duration of study demonstrates the efficacy of this approach for preventing development of morbid obesity in leptindeficient mice.</p><p>Consistent with earlier studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ealey et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hamrick et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Iwaniec et al. 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Williams et al. 2011)</ref>, ob/ob mice exhibited a mosaic skeletal phenotype associated with decreased bone formation due to reduced osteoblast number and activity, and defective osteoclast function. Femurs from ob/ob mice were smaller and had thinner cortices than those from WT mice. Furthermore, serum osteocalcin levels, mRNA levels for osteocalcin and SP7 (osterix), osteoblast perimeter and dynamic indices of bone formation were lower in ob/ob mice than in WT mice. However, cancellous bone volume fraction in both distal femur and lumbar vertebra was higher in the ob/ob mice. The higher cancellous bone volume fraction was associated with (1) greatly reduced serum CTx levels, (2) reductions in mRNA levels for NFKB, Itgam and Icam1, (3) retention of calcified cartilage, and (4) retention of fluorochrome label administered at study initiation, all indicative of a defect in bone resorption. Osteoclast perimeter was either unaffected (distal femur metaphysis and lumbar vertebra) or increased (distal femur epiphysis), indicating that reduced bone resorption in ob/ob mice was not due to an inability to generate osteoclasts. Taken together, these findings further support our previous observation that ob/ob mice exhibit mild osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis due to a defect in osteoclast function may be responsible for the poor bone quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Ealey et al. 2006</ref>) and defective tooth eruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Batt 1978</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Batt , 1992) )</ref> reported in ob/ob mice.</p><p>Pair-feeding accentuated many of the abnormalities in bone size, mass, microarchitecture, gene expression, and turnover typically observed in ob/ob mice. Thus, chronic excessive weight gain typically present in ob/ob mice reduces the magnitude of skeletal effects associated with leptin deficiency. We did not adjust μCT-derived cortical bone data for body weight differences because the association between body weight and bone size and density in growing mice varies with bone and bone compartment and this association is altered by leptin <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Iwaniec, et al. 2009</ref>). However, it is clear that the weight gain due to hyperphagia in ob/ob mice was associated with increases in cortical bone accrual but that these gains were not commensurate with the magnitude of body weight gain.</p><p>The mechanisms for the partial protective effect of morbid obesity on bone in ob/ob mice are likely to be multifactorial. We have previously reported a strong positive correlation between body weight and total femur bone mass in ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Iwaniec et al. 2009)</ref>. This finding provides strong evidence that the higher total and cortical bone mass in ad libitumfed compared to pair-fed ob/ob mice are, at least in part, attributable to higher body weight. Although there have been significant recent advances in our understanding of regulation of bone metabolism by mechanotransduction, the molecular mechanism for this positive effect of weight on bone mass is largely unknown. In addition to direct effects of increased mechanical loading, changes in levels of hormones and/or growth factors may mediate additional effects of increased weight on the skeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Robling 2012)</ref>.</p><p>We did not measure levels of insulin, glucocorticoids, or norepinephrine, factors known to be dysregulated in ob/ob mice <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Dubuc, et al. 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kim and Romsos 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Knehans and Romsos 1982;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Rafael and Herling 2000)</ref> and known to influence bone metabolism. However, housing food-restricted ob/ob mice at thermoneutral temperature has been reported to reduce abnormalities in blood glucose, insulin, glucocorticoids, and norepinephrine turnover.

As a consequence, ob/ob mice are severely hypogonadal <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chehab, et al. 2002)</ref>. The resulting deficiency in sex steroids would be expected to play a role in the pathological skeletal changes associated with leptin deficiency because sex steroids, especially estrogen, contribute to the sexual dimorphism of the female skeleton and regulate bone turnover balance in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Rickard, et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Turner, et al. 1989;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Turner, et al. 1994)</ref>. Gonadal dysfunction typically results in elevated bone turnover and cancellous osteopenia. The difference between the skeletal responses to gonadal hormone insufficiency resulting from gonadectomy (high turnover) and from leptin-deficiency (low turnover) is perplexing. However, estrogen has a tonic effect on bone resorption and leptin is required for normal osteoclast function. As a consequence, high bone turnover generally associated with estrogen deficiency may be attenuated in ob/ob mice due to impaired osteoclast function. We speculate that the requirement for leptin in normal osteoclast function may serve as a counter regulatory mechanism to prevent excessive bone loss during fasting.</p><p>We did not measure sex steroid levels but the higher uterine weight in ad libitum-fed ob/ob mice compared to pair-fed ob/ob mice implies that morbid obesity results in a small increase in circulating estrogen. Higher estrogen levels in blood or adipose tissue may contribute to the protective skeletal effects of morbid obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gennari, et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Turner 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Turner et al. 1994)</ref>. Aromatase, the enzyme responsible for conversion of androgens to estrogens, is expressed by adipocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gennari et al. 2011</ref>). Thus, adipose-derived estrogen is a plausible mechanism contributing to the skeletal differences between pair-fed and ad libitum-fed ob/ob mice.</p><p>Initially heavier, ob/ob mice pair-fed to WT mice remained heavier than WT mice for the duration of study. We chose to equalize energy availability rather than body weight in the present study because bone accrual in rapidly growing rodents is strongly associated with energy availability and bone loss accompanies weight loss in adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Devlin, et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Turner and Iwaniec 2011)</ref>. Low leptin levels induced by caloric restriction are associated with diminished bone mass accrual whereas partial leptin signaling deficiency induced in ad lib-fed mice by treatment with a leptin antagonist increased body weight and bone mass accrual <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Solomon, et al. 2014)</ref>. However, administration of leptin increases bone formation in adult ob/ob mice in spite of weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bartell et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Turner et al. 2013</ref>). Thus, both adequate energy availability and leptin play important roles in bone accrual in growing mice.</p><p>In contrast to peripheral fat depots, which act as dynamic energy reservoirs to maintain circulating triglyceride and free fatty acid levels during feeding and fasting, marrow fat increases with severe weight loss as well as weight gain <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bredella, et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Devlin 2011)</ref>. It is therefore unlikely that the bone marrow fat depot serves as an important energy reservoir for peripheral tissues. There is, however, evidence that bone marrow adipocytes function as negative regulators of hematopoietic lineage cell differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dorshkind, et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Gimble, et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Naveiras, et al. 2009)</ref>.

Leptin stimulates hematopoiesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Fantuzzi and Faggioni 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Trottier, et al. 2012</ref>), an action that may be due to inhibition of bone marrow adipogenesis, increased lipolysis, and direct stimulatory actions on hematopoietic cells. Adipocytes and osteoblasts are derived from the same bone marrow mesenchymal precursor and a reciprocal association between osteoblast number and adipocyte number has often been noted, giving rise to the hypothesis that bone marrow adipocytes may either antagonize osteoblast production or, alternatively, generation of adipocytes precludes generation of osteoblasts <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Akune, et al. 2004)</ref>. Other studies suggest that adipocyte and osteoblast number in bone marrow can be independently regulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Iwaniec and Turner 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Menagh et al. 2010)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bartell et al. (2011)</ref> reported that intracerebroventricular administration of leptin to ob/ob mice increases expression of SP7, a transcription factor critical for osteoblast differentiation. Our findings of low expression of SP7 in ob/ob mice support the hypothesis that leptin acts to regulate bone formation by controlling mesenchymal cell decision.</p><p>In the present study, pair feeding to WT mice resulted in a further increase in bone marrow adiposity in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Of interest is our finding that pair-fed ob/ob mice had elevated mRNA levels for CD36; CD36 (fatty acid translocase) promotes adipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Christiaens, et al. 2012)</ref>. The observed increase in CD36 may play a role in the increased bone marrow adiposity observed in the pair-fed ob/ob mice. Additional factors regulating bone marrow adiposity that may be influenced by leptin levels and obesity include growth hormone and IGF1. In rats, treatment with parathyroid hormone (whose actions on bone are largely mediated through IGF1) prevented the increase in bone marrow adiposity associated with severe energy restriction <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Turner and Iwaniec 2011)</ref>, whereas growth hormone treatment dramatically reduced excessive bone marrow adiposity in severely hypoleptinemic hypophysectomized rats <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Menagh et al. 2010</ref>). In both of these studies, treatment had no effect on serum leptin levels. ob/ob mice, however, have decreased circulating growth hormone and impaired growth hormone signaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Luque, et al. 2007)</ref>, likely contributing to retention of fat within the bone marrow. High circulating insulin levels in morbidly obese ob/ob mice may further contribute to the suppression of growth hormone synthesis and release <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Luque and Kineman 2006)</ref>. However, IGF1 is produced and secreted by adipocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Kloting, et al. 2008</ref>) and higher levels of IGF1 are detected in obese subjects <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Frystyk, et al. 1999)</ref>. Low leptin levels resulting from severe energy restriction are associated with increased growth hormone secretion, decreased circulating levels of IGF1, and end-organ resistance to growth hormone <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Douyon and Schteingart 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Grinspoon, et al. 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Inagaki, et al. 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Munoz and Argente 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Thissen, et al. 1999</ref>). Thus, disturbances in growth hormone, IGF1 and insulin signaling as well as leptin deficiency may contribute to the increase in bone marrow adiposity in ob/ob mice. Chronic hyperphagia and excessive weight gain typically observed in ob/ob mice may partially compensate for leptin deficiency and reduced bone marrow adiposity by altering growth hormone and insulin levels and sensitivity.</p><p>In summary, leptin deficiency resulted in decreased femur length, BMC, BMD, and cortical bone volume and thickness. In contrast, cancellous bone volume fraction was increased in distal femur and lumbar vertebra. The profound changes in bone mass, density, and microarchitecture were associated with reduced linear bone growth, increased bone marrow adiposity, altered expression of osteogenic genes, decreased osteoblast number, and decreased osteoclast function. Prevention of morbid obesity in ob/ob mice further exacerbated many of the abnormalities associated with leptin deficiency. Because morbid obesity normally present in ob/ob mice attenuates the abnormal skeletal phenotype associated with leptin deficiency, the role of leptin in regulating postnatal bone growth, maturation, and turnover may have been underestimated.
