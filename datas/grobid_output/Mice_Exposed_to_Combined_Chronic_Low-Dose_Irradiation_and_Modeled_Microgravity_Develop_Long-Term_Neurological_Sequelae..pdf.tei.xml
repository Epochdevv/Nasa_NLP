<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Spaceflight poses many challenges for humans. Ground-based analogs typically focus on single parameters of spaceflight and their associated acute effects. This study assesses the long-term transcriptional effects following single and combination spaceflight analog conditions using the mouse model: simulated microgravity via hindlimb unloading (HLU) and/or low-dose γ-ray irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by 4 months of readaptation. Changes in gene expression and epigenetic modifications in brain samples during readaptation were analyzed by whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). The results showed minimal gene expression and cytosine methylation alterations at 4 months readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR. In contrast, following combined HLU+LDR, gene expression and promoter methylation analyses showed multiple altered pathways involved in neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, the regulation of neuropeptides, and cellular signaling. In brief, neurological readaptation following combined chronic LDR and HLU is a dynamic process that involves pathways that regulate neuronal function and structure and may lead to late onset neurological sequelae.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The central nervous system (CNS) is vulnerable to irradiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and fluid shifts <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> experienced during short-and long-term spaceflight. An important goal for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is to identify the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on the CNS to better prepare astronauts during long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars. During missions beyond low-earth orbit (LEO), astronauts will be continuously exposed to low-dose ionizing radiation (LDR). While high linear energy transfer (LET) galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) and low LET solar particle event (SPE) radiation contribute large portions of the radiation dose accumulated by astronaut crew members <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, interactions between GCR and SPE particles and spacecraft release secondary radiation including γ-rays that can deliver a significant fraction of the total mission does <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In addition, altered gravity (hypergravity experienced at launch/landing and microgravity experienced in-flight) affects homeostatic fluid-shifting in the CNS. Studies examining readaptation to Earth's gravity are of equal importance, as recovery from spaceflight exposure may require medical intervention, in particular within organs known to be sensitive to irradiation and fluid shifts.</p><p>Astronauts in spaceflight experience impairments in neurocognition (as measured by altered decision making and problem solving) and neurobehavior (as measured by impaired visual perceptions, motor controls and sleep-wake cycles) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. The NASA Twins study offers some additional insight into post-flight cognitive decline that persists up to 6 months post-flight (end of experimental sampling) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Longitudinal diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data collected from astronauts pre-and post-flight (shuttle missions &lt;30 days and ISS mission &lt;200 days) revealed whole brain shifting within the skull and white matter disruptions, suggesting spaceflight leads to long-term alterations of brain structure in humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</p><p>Rodent models offer an appropriate alternative to assess the effects of spaceflight-like conditions on brain tissue. Recently, the Rodent Research (RR)-1 mission flew mice to the International Space Station (ISS) for 33 days and measured neurobehavioral outcomes through video monitoring, which indicated 16-week old (at launch) females displayed unique group hyperactivity behavior at 2 weeks post-launch, implying neurological disruptions occur in flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Moreover, long-term readaptation to chronic LDR and hindlimb unloading (HLU) (a ground-based analog of spaceflight) resulted in increased aquaporin-4 (AQP4) protein expression, oxidative stress damage, apoptosis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) compromise and an increase in neurobehavioral risk-taking behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>The effects of acute radiation doses on the CNS have been well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. However, responses to chronic LDR exposure, as encountered on space missions (&lt;0.04 Gy/y), are not well investigated <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, particularly in a pan-transcriptome context. Moreover, long-term readaptive outcomes on neurohealth following spaceflight-like conditions are less studied. Due to the need to better understand the transcriptional changes associated with chronic LDR in combination with reduced gravity (unloading) on neurohealth, mice were exposed to chronic LDR γ-ray irradiation (0.04 Gy), HLU, or a combination of HLU+LDR for 21 days, followed by a 4-month readaptation period. Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) data were analyzed for differentially expressed genes (DEG), while data from reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) were analyzed to determine differentially methylated promoters (DMP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Overall, we found minimal gene alterations at 4 months of readaptation within single treatment conditions of HLU or LDR, namely, in pathways related to the reduced expression of translational machinery, while the combination of HLU+LDR resulted in a wide panel of altered DEG and DMP profiles for tight junctions, aquaporins, neurogenesis markers and neuropeptides. Therefore, exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to mild, long-term neurological consequences, while readaptation is an active process involving neuroplasticity and repair that is cooperatively engaged post-HLU+LDR exposure to maintain neural homeostasis.</p></div>

Baseline weight measurements were taken on day 0, prior to the initiation of HLU and LDR exposure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">LDR, HLU and Combined HLU+LDR Exposures Displayed Minimal Gene and Promoter Methylation Overlap at 4 Months Readaptation</head><p>Given that there were significant changes in gene expression in the combined exposure to HLU+LDR mice at the 4-month timepoint, we next determined whether these changes in gene expression reflected modifications to cytosine methylation using RRBS analysis. RRBS revealed 137, 71 and 170 differentially methylated promoters (DMPs) in the LDR, HLU, and HLU+LDR animals, respectively (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). A full list of DMPs is provided in supplementary data (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">S2</ref>). To find overlap across assays and experimental conditions, gene sets were created from DEG (upregulated/downregulated) and genes corresponding to DMPs (hypermethylated/hypomethylated). Overlapping genes between these sets were determined (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>) and summarized in an UpSet diagram <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). Overall, there was little overlap between assays and experimental conditions (grey bars/dots/line). Most overlap was observed between DMPs from different experimental conditions (red bars/dots/lines). Overlap between DEGs from different experimental conditions was minimal (blue bars/dots/lines). Overlap between DEGs and DMPs from the same experimental condition or from different experimental conditions were also minimal (black bars/dots/lines). Collectively, these results indicated most DEGs and DMPs are unique to their experimental condition with minimal overlap between exposure groups.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Discussion</head><p>Herein, we identified that chronic exposure (21 days) to single or combined HLU and LDR resulted in long-term transcriptional alterations in CNS brain tissue in female mice at 4 months post-exposure. The gene expression changes observed here imply reduced transcriptional machinery, increased neurogenesis and neuropeptide production, and dysregulated cell structure and cell signaling. These studies offer translational value into pathways regulated in humans, as gene ontology analyses identified similar genetic overlap between mice and human profiles, in particular in pathways involved in neurodevelopmental homeostasis and signal transduction. Collectively, brain-related transcriptional changes that are dynamic in readaptation from exposure to spaceflight-like conditions may lead to long-term neurological consequences. Indeed, 21 days of exposure to combined HLU+LDR did not result in immediate neurobehavioral deficits (1 week post-exposure); however, increased risk-taking behavior was observed at 9 months post-exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, indicating delayed neurological impairments in a combination of HLU+LDR, that was not apparent in HLU or LDR only.</p><p>To assess CNS effects, 4-month post-experimental conditions mid/hindbrain (sans cerebellum and brainstem) were collected, sectioned, and total RNA was isolated for RNA-seq analysis. This portion of the brain houses the hippocampus, basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and thalamus, and is a major signaling hub for the neuroendocrine system (hypothalamus and pituitary gland). Mid/hindbrain sections were assessed to localize the transcriptional profile to a region that is central to neurogenesis (hippocampus) and hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) responses, in order to better assess neurofunctional output without potential contamination from the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. The results displayed robust DEG alterations within combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation compared to controls, and marginal DEG alterations in single HLU or LDR at 4 months readaptation. At 4 months post-HLU exposure, DEGs including EphrB3 and Sh2d5 were altered, suggesting cell morphological and structural changes are active at this timepoint. At 4 months post-LDR exposure, only five DEGs were found, four of which have an unknown function. One DEG, Rps13, was reduced, suggesting impaired protein synthesis and/or other functional outputs mediated by ribosomes. Interestingly, Rps13 was also reduced in HLU alone at 4 months readaptation along with other protein synthesis-related genes, including Hist1h2bc and Rpl36a-ps2, collectively suggesting fundamental translational pathways are altered during chronic HLU and LDR during readaptation. In line with this, another group has reported that chronic LDR whole brain irradiation resulted in protein synthesis impairment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> that can affect adult neurogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Interestingly, no notable protein synthesis pathway deficits were identified in combined HLU+LDR exposures, suggesting distinct responses are generated within each experimental condition at readaptation. Moreover, very limited DEG overlap was observed between experimental conditions, further validating unique responses to each condition and highlighting the importance of implementing combined exposure studies to better assess spaceflight-like readaptation effects on the nervous system. Other spaceflight-like factors such as hypoxia and social isolation were not assessed in this study and merit further investigation. Nonetheless, the usefulness of this model provides a scaffold for future studies to assess the long-term effects of combination HLU+LDR on the health of the nervous system.</p><p>Brain structural damage through disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is associated with neurodegeneration and subsequent behavioral dysfunctions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Our previous study showed that aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a water-channel protein involved in brain water homeostasis, was up-regulated following combined exposure to irradiation and unloading <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, suggesting a disturbance in BBB integrity may lead to edema <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Furthermore, AQP4 induction was seen in concert with subtle behavioral changes at 9 months post-exposure <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, indicating a potential role for BBB dysfunction and neurobehavioral consequences. Although Aqp4 was not identified in this study, Aqp1 gene expression was induced following combination of HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, suggesting similar BBB disturbances and possible shifts in brain water homeostasis <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. In line with this, the induction of aquaporins may be linked to neuroinflammation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, while the upregulation of additional immune activation markers including Cd74, H2-Ab1, C1ql2 and Ifit-3 were also identified in combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, along with hypomethylated Cfi and Mx1, collectively suggesting chronic neuroinflammation may persist during brain readaptation post-combined HLU+LDR exposure.</p><p>In response to extracellular cues (i.e., edema), cells rearrange their structures and ion transport proteins to maintain equilibrium <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Furthermore, neuroplasticity is a homeostatic repair mechanism that involves the formation of new synapses and neural processes to compensate for their communication loss following brain infarct, injury or disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. These new formations result in brain restructuring and function, which may be occurring during readaptation post-combined HLU+LDR exposures. Indeed, our results fall in line with responses that were observed within brains isolated hours post-LDR (10 cGy) exposure, whereby multiple synaptic ion transport genes were altered <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Herein, multiple cell structural genes, i.e., Drc7, Dnah7b and Fmnl1 and ion transport genes, i.e., Gria3, Grin2a, Calb2, Scn5a, Clcn5, Kcnj13, Kcnn1 and Kcnh1, were altered post-combination HLU+LDR conditions. Moreover, hypomethylation analyses indicated altered cytoskeletal organization, i.e., Ndel1, Cald1 and Lmod3 were observed in both LDR and HLU, suggesting cellular structural changes involved in neuroplasticity and readaptation processes are active, in order to restructure and/or maintain brain homeostasis.</p><p>Tight junctions, including claudins, connexins, and occludins contribute to BBB permeability and maintenance. A reduction in these molecules has been implicated in acute BBB disruption in neuroviral <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and neuroinflammatory diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. In line with this, Cdh12 was downregulated, whereas, Cldn2 was induced in combination of HLU+LDR. Furthermore, Cdhr4 was hypomethylated in both LDR alone and HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, while Cdhr2 was hypomethylated in LDR and HLU alone, but not in combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, suggesting BBB restructuring, and further indicating the dynamic process of brain physiology during readaptation.</p><p>Adult neurogenesis is a process of neural and glia self-renewal and the generation of progenitor cells from radial glial cells (RGCs) within the subventricular and subgranular zones of the hippocampus <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. RGCs are quiescent and are activated to initiate neurogenesis in response to a stimulus <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, such as LDR <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> or models of increased intracranial pressure <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>. Indeed, the majority of highly upregulated DEGs post-combination HLU+LDR were involved in HPA signaling, neuropeptide growth factors, and neurogenesis, i.e., Otp, Uncx, Ucn3, Avp, Pmch, Prox1, Calb2, Tbr-1, and Hcrt. While the magnitude of gene expression does not always result in observable phenotypes, these notable DEGs may serve an important purpose in neuromaintenance during readaptation. Interestingly, Crh, a stress-induced hormone, was hypermethylated post-exposure to LDR and combination HLU+LDR at 4 months readaptation, implying transcriptional silencing of Crh may be engaged to suppress robust HPA activity during readaptation, which warrants further studies.</p><p>Readaptation results from combined exposures to HLU+LDR are in agreement with literature that spaceflight can alter neurofunction. Indeed, neurocognitive and behavioral effects via altered decision making, problem solving, visual perceptions, motor controls, and sleep-wake cycles have all been identified in flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. While "space-brain" characteristics have suggested astronauts are at risk of developing neurological sequelae in flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and post-flight <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. Due to the limitations of human neurological studies, mouse models provide an excellent alternative, with the caveat that fluid shifts in mice are marginal in comparison to their human counterparts. Therefore, follow-up studies utilizing larger mammals, i.e., rats, may provide more robust responses. Further, readaptation effects from radiation have been described to cause differential nervous system responses in sex, age, type of irradiation, duration of exposure and total doses <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, while the readaptation effects of prolonged HLU on the neurohealth of different sexes and age groups are still unclear. Therefore, future studies approaching these additional demographics, both modeled in mice or rats, are required. Nonetheless, our readaptation study in mice exposed to combined HLU+LDR displayed a panel of neurological changes that were translational to humans, suggesting this is a suitable animal model to study spaceflight-related readaptation effects on the nervous system. Additionally, future studies should expand the types of radiation exposure animals experience in order to fully capture the spectrum of radiation that bombards astronauts during spaceflight. The space radiation environment beyond LEO contains several types of ionizing radiation. Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) with relatively high linear energy transfer (LET) and proton radiation due to solar particle events (SPEs) contribute a significant portion of the radiation dose accumulated by astronaut crew members <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. High-energy heavy ions (HZE radiation) can produce distinct patterns of energy deposition in cells and tissues <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. However, secondary particles produced by the interaction of SPE protons and heavy-charged GCR particles with the spacecraft structure include γ-rays and x-rays <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. These radiation sources can also deliver a significant fraction of the total mission dose and pose a hazard to astronauts' health <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. For chronic irradiation exposure, we used flood sources consisting of plastic sheets embedded with the isotope 57 Co that emits medium energy (122 and 136 keV) γ-rays. Additional research is needed to elucidate the CNS damage and readaptation response induced by the full spectrum of space radiation.</p><p>In summary, a multitude of neurological effects and persistent brain transcriptional alterations were observed at 4 months post-HLU+LDR in 21-day exposures. Changes included reduced transcriptional machinery, increased neurogenesis and neuropeptide production, and dysregulated cell structure and signaling genes. Thus, brain-related transcriptional changes are dynamic and plastic during readaptation from exposure to spaceflight-like conditions, and while these exposures may lead to long-term neurological consequences, the active processes of neuroplasticity and repair are engaged to maintain neural homeostasis.</p></div>
