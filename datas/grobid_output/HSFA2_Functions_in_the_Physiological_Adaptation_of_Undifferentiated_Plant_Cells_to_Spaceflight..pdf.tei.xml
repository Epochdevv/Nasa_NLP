<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Heat Shock Factor A2 (HsfA2) is part of the Heat Shock Factor (HSF) network, and plays an essential role beyond heat shock in environmental stress responses and cellular homeostatic control. Arabidopsis thaliana cell cultures derived from wild type (WT) ecotype Col-0 and a knockout line deficient in the gene encoding HSFA2 (HSFA2 KO) were grown aboard the International Space Station (ISS) to ascertain whether the HSF network functions in the adaptation to the novel environment of spaceflight. Microarray gene expression data were analyzed using a two-part comparative approach. First, genes differentially expressed between the two environments (spaceflight to ground) were identified within the same genotype, which represented physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Second, gene expression profiles were compared between the two genotypes (HSFA2 KO to WT) within the same environment, which defined genes uniquely required by each genotype on the ground and in spaceflight-adapted states. Results showed that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) define the HSFA2 KO cells' physiological state irrespective of the environment, and likely resulted from a deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery in the mutant. Results further suggested that additional to its universal stress response role, HsfA2 also has specific roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through cell wall remodeling, signal perception and transduction, and starch biosynthesis. Disabling HsfA2 altered the physiological state of the cells, and impacted the mechanisms induced to adapt to spaceflight, and identified HsfA2-dependent genes that are important to the adaption of wild type cells to spaceflight. Collectively these data indicate a non-thermal role for the HSF network in spaceflight adaptation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Survival in a challenging environment requires a coordinated system that enables a living organism to respond appropriately to a change. The environment of the International Space Station (ISS) presents novel challenges for all terrestrial organisms, which evolved in the unit gravity of Earth. Microgravity is the most obvious challenge of spaceflight; however, other aspects of the spaceflight environment, such as radiation from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles, and vibration contribute to the complexity of this novel environment. When terrestrial organisms are transported to the ISS, they respond by adjusting metabolic processes to physiologically adapt to this new spaceflight environment. One readout of the physiological changes induced by spaceflight is in the patterns of gene expression. Plants are extremely sensitive to changes in their environment, and are particularity attuned to changes in gravity. Individual genes have been implicated as important to the altered gravity physiological adaptation through assays with deletion mutants <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref> and with specific assays of expression <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Genome-wide evaluations have also provided a large-scale view of the changes elicited by disrupted terrestrial gravity environments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</p><p>Plants exhibit widespread changes in their patterns of gene expression in the absence of gravity, such as in response to the spaceflight environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Even unicellular plants are capable of sensing a change in the gravitational environment and there have been several spaceflight experiments that examine the transcriptomes of single plant cells, and undifferentiated plants cells, which also lack traditional gravity-sensing organs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. The wealth of information on the transcriptional changes that accompany the adjustments to spaceflight begins to suggest common strategies for adjusting to the spaceflight environment; however, the underlying question of why certain genes are necessary remains unanswered. One group of genes strongly represented in many spaceflight transcriptomes is composed of the heat shock transcription factors and proteins that comprise the Heat Shock Factor network <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</p><p>Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) are transcription factors that activate the expression of genes in response to almost any environmental stress and are essential to the cellular homeostatic control mechanisms (for review, please see <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>). HSF genes are evolutionarily conserved and are represented in the genomes of almost every organism. Given the conservation of the HSF network and its general roles in stress responses, it was perhaps not surprising to see HSFs represented in the response to spaceflight in plants. Their particularly strong representation in cell cultures; however, suggested HSFs could play a unique role in the spaceflight response of undifferentiated cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>One hallmark of cellular stress is the accumulation of denatured proteins. The main gene targets of HSF-induced transcriptional activation are the stress response proteins that act as molecular chaperones <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. These chaperones not only protect a cell from denatured protein accumulation, but also assure proper protein folding and maturation of newly synthesized proteins indispensable in response to stress. The Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs) are the main chaperones of the folding machinery, but there are also other non-chaperone proteins assisting in efficient protein maturation <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. For instance, a pair of enzymes, including a disulfide carrier protein (protein disulfide isomerase, PDI), and a disulfide-generating enzyme (endoplasmic oxidoreductin-1, ERO1 and protein disulfide isomerase, PDI, PDIs/ERO1) catalyze oxidative protein folding by creating disulfide bonds, thereby assisting in proper protein sorting <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</p><p>Protein folding occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which also serves as the main hub for the secretory pathways and protein delivery to their final destinations. The ER uses an extensive surveillance called the Endoplasmic Reticulum Quality Control (ERQC) system, which assures that only properly folded proteins exit the ER and maintains proper physiological homeostasis in the ER <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>. When there is an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, a stress signal is emitted. Initially, a cell activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) intended to increase the ER folding capacity in an attempt to refold the aberrant proteins <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>. If these UPR solutions to the unfolded protein accumulation problem fail, or if the accumulation of misfolded proteins is massive, then the final UPR step-the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD)-is activated. The ERAD eliminates and destroys the misfolded proteins via proteasome digestion, preventing further protein aggregation. The luminal lectin OS9 in cooperation with a membrane spanning protein SEL1/HRD3 recognizes the unfolded glycosylated proteins which are then ubiquitinylated by the HRD1 E3 ligase, removed from the ER lumen, and degraded by the 26S proteasome in the cytoplasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>. Taken collectively, ER homeostasis works as a sensor for environmental stimuli, and the ER stress signal initiates a subcellular stress response system that can secure protein homeostasis during environmental changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>.</p><p>The HsfA2 gene is a member of the large family of Hsf genes in the HSF network and is a key regulator of the defense response via HSP chaperone transcriptional activation to several types of environmental stresses, namely extreme temperatures (high and low), hydrogen peroxide, and high light intensity <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>. The HSFA2 protein has been demonstrated itself to be the main coordinator of the UPR during heat stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>. The critical involvement of HSFA2 in the response to extreme environments makes it an excellent target candidate for studying the effects of spaceflight on plants and to test if plants use the same universal stress response mechanism evolved terrestrially to accommodate the novel space gravitational environment.</p><p>HSFA2 may also have an additional role in the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment beyond the UPR induction of the chaperone-based protein folding machinery. The genes encoding HSFs and HSPs were reported to be upregulated in spaceflight in many biological systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>. The HsfA2 gene specifically was the highest upregulated gene in the wild type Arabidopsis cell cultures after 12 days in space <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. Moreover, HSFA2 was shown to function in amplification of the signal in response to brassinosteroids, calcium, and auxin and was reported to be affected in Arabidopsis in spaceflight, and therefore has the potential for playing a role in the gravity sensing signal transduction cascade <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>. In the unicellular yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the HSF targets represent nearly 3% of the genome and the diversity of their functions supports a broad role for HSF in coordinating the multitude of cellular processes occurring in normal and stressful conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. Since the HSFs play a role in various cellular processes such as development, cellular lifespan, cell differentiation and proliferation, the likelihood that HSFA2 will play some role in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight increases <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>.</p><p>Cell lines from wild type (WT) Col-0 and an HsfA2 knockout (HSFA2 KO) in the same Col-0 background were launched to the International Space Station (ISS) for the Cellular Expression Logic (CEL) experiment, which was a component of the Biological Research In Cannisters 17 (BRIC17) payload. The experiments here compare samples fixed in orbit after growth in space to samples grown on the ground. Descriptions and discussions will consider not only the spaceflight adaptation experience for each genotype, but also the gene expression profiles in the ground and spaceflight environments between genotypes. It was our goal to develop a better understanding of how cells, disabled in a primary regulator of environmental stress response, react to an unfamiliar environment outside of their evolutionary experience. The results of the spaceflight experiment presented here have enhanced our understanding not only of HSFA2's role in adjusting to novel environments, but also the broader scope of the processes involved spaceflight physiological adaptation in plant cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Results</head><p>In this experiment, the pattern of gene expression that defined the adapted state was established after ten days of growth in the BRIC hardware in two environments: spaceflight, and ground control in the two genotypes: HSFA2 KO, and WT. Cell clusters of both genotypes were applied in comparable density for both treatments, and continued growth in the spaceflight and ground control environments (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>Microarray gene expression data were analyzed in two dimensions. The first or "vertical" dimension of the analysis involved the typical comparison of the gene expression profiles of the cells grown in spaceflight to those grown on the ground for each of the two cell lines (see red box in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>, and refer also to <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> for a similar experimental design). For clarity, this vertical comparison was termed the physiological adaptation to the spaceflight environment of either HSFA2 KO or WT cells. Genes identified in this vertical comparison contribute to understanding which cellular processes were sensitive to spaceflight in each genotype. The second or "horizontal" dimension of the analysis involved comparison of gene expression profiles between the two genotypes within the same environment: ground (see green box of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>) and spaceflight (see blue box of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>). In the ground horizontal comparison, gene expression in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground was compared to gene expression in WT cells on the ground, thus defining unique genes of the ground adapted state for each genotype. Similarly, in a spaceflight horizontal comparison, the gene expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight was compared to gene expression in WT cells in spaceflight, thus defining unique genes required for the spaceflight adapted state in each genotype. Finally, the sets of genes obtained from a comparison of the first and second dimension were analyzed together, and their interdependence was examined. The gene expression datasets were abbreviated as follows: Ground Control WT (G Wt ), Ground Control HSFA2 KO (G Hsf ), Spaceflight WT (F Wt ) and Spaceflight HSFA2 KO (F Hsf ). The WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight was identified in the F Wt : G Wt comparison group (see red box on the left in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>), the HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight was identified in the F Hsf : G Hsf comparison group (red box on the right in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>), the genotypic adaptation to ground was identified in the G Hsf : G Wt comparison group (see green box at the bottom in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>), and the genotypic adaptation to spaceflight was identified in the F Hsf : F Wt comparison group (blue box on top in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2A</ref>).

The WT cells and the cells disabled in expression of the HsfA2 gene both survived their orbits in the ISS, indicating that they both had adapted their physiology to the novel environment despite their genotypic differences. Cells disabled in HSFA2 function used substantially more and substantially different gene expression profiles to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state compared to WT cells. This observation leads to a remarkable conclusion about the role of the HSF network in the entire adaptation processes to spaceflight-proficient spaceflight adaptation requires a functional HSF network.</p><p>This conclusion suggests that various aspects of HSFA2 and the HSF network illuminate important components of spaceflight adaptation in plant cells.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Universal and Specific Aspects of the HSFA2 Role in the Adaptation to Spaceflight</head><p>Inevitably, the physiological adaptation to a change in the environment, including the novel change of ground to spaceflight, requires de novo protein synthesis followed by protein maturation and transport. Therefore, when a population of cells transitions to the spaceflight environment, the demands on a cell to synthesize and mature new proteins manifests in a unique manner. Unlike WT cells, the HSFA2 KO cells activated the UPR as part of a strategy to adapt to spaceflight, implicating that the ability to fold proteins adequately was compromised in the HSFA2 KO cells. As previously observed at the molecular level in response to a multitude of other environmental stimuli, HSFA2 was likely working to secure cellular protein homeostasis, and the inefficiency in protein folding observed in space flown HSFA2 KO cells likely resulted from the limited HSFA2-governed regulation of molecular chaperone genes. For instance, the PDI gene, ATPDIL2-3 (At2g32920), the transcription factors WRKY33 (At2g38470), and AtGATA-1 (At3g24050) along with four other genes (Ypt/Rab-GAP domain of gyp1p superfamily protein (At3g49350), SAG21 (At4g02380), transmembrane proteins 14c (At1g50740), and unknown (At1g19020)), all of which were reported to be a part of the UPR, were tuniquely abundant in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Moreover, the pivotal gene of the ERAD, HRD3A (At1g18260), also showed enhanced expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight conditions, demonstrating activation of the destruction pathway for aberrant proteins. These results cumulatively suggest that the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight suffered from excessive aggregation of misfolded proteins and that to get rid of these misfolded and cumbersome aggregates, a degradation pathway was upregulated in order to actively remove them.</p><p>Additionally, the genes of intracellular protein transport and secretion, such as Transducin/WD40 repeat-like superfamily protein (AT1G18830) alias SEC31-like protein transporter, target SNARE coiled-coil domain protein (AT1G29060) and the Coatomer beta subunit (AT3G15980), which functions specifically in ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, were also upregulated in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells in the spaceflight-adapted state <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The ATARFA1D (AT1G70490) gene coding Ras-related small GTP-binding family protein, known to be essential for vesicle coating and un-coating <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, was also upregulated in space-flown HSFA2 KO cells. This suggests that the protein sorting and delivery processes were impaired in space flown HSFA2 KO cells and that the over-induction of multiple vesicle-mediated protein transport genes was an attempt to circumvent an inefficient system of intracellular protein trafficking. As such, HSFA2 plays a role in processes involved when a cell physiologically adapts to spaceflight similar to its role as a universal coordinator of the stress response when plants adapt to a broad range of other environmental changes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref>). However, the expression patterns in the spaceflight-adapted state of the genes related to cell wall construction, signal transduction and starch biosynthesis in HSFA2 KO cells in comparison to WT cells imply more specific roles for HSFA2 beyond the universal stress response coordination.</p><p>The HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight likely have a fundamentally different architecture from the wild type cell wall, along with diminished processes of cell growth, expansion, and elongation as identified by the altered gene expression profiles. Many genes encoding proteins important to these processes are downregulated in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. For instance, the gene coding glycosyltransferase QUA1 (At3g25140), involved in homogalacturonan biosynthesis and cell adhesion, the trichome birefringence-like 45 (TBL45 (At2g30010)), which functions in the synthesis and deposition of secondary wall cellulose, and XTH4 (AT2G06850), which executes the cleavage and reconnection of cell wall xyloglucan cross-links. It was shown for many plant systems that spaceflight caused changes to the cell wall organization; thus, the finding of this study suggests that HSFA2 may have a role in the way a plant cell remodels its wall to adapt to spaceflight microgravity <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. Given that cells deficient in HsfA2 expression show signs of ER stress and impaired protein sorting and intracellular protein trafficking, it is possible that the proteins of the cell wall biosynthesis do not properly mature within ER, and thus fail to be properly sorted or delivered to their destination at the cell wall periphery <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57]</ref>. However, the heat shock transcription factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hsf1, was shown to regulate cell wall remodeling in response to heat shock in a more specific fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</p><p>The yeast strain mutated in Hsf1 exhibited cell wall integrity defects in the absence of stress and Hsf1 was demonstrated to regulate the expression of a set of proteins that are involved in cell wall formation and remodeling besides the universal regulation of the HSPs' expression. The overexpression of a heat shock protein Hsp150 in S. cerevisiae caused upregulation of many cell wall proteins, leading to increased cell wall integrity and potentially enhanced the yeasts' virulence <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Also, the Hsf genes were found among regulatory pathways in secondary cell wall thickening in Medicago truncatula using microarrays <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. These examples further support HSFA2's specific role in the remodeling of Arabidopsis cell wall architecture in the spaceflight environment.</p><p>Transducin/WD40 repeat-like superfamily protein (AT1G18830) alias SEC31-like protein transporter, target SNARE coiled-coil domain protein (AT1G29060) and the Coatomer beta subunit (AT3G15980), which functions specifically in ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport, were also upregulated in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells in the spaceflight-adapted state <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. The ATARFA1D (AT1G70490) gene coding Ras-related small GTP-binding family protein, known to be essential for vesicle coating and un-coating <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, was also upregulated in space-flown HSFA2 KO cells. This suggests that the protein sorting and delivery processes were impaired in space flown HSFA2 KO cells and that the over-induction of multiple vesicle-mediated protein transport genes was an attempt to circumvent an inefficient system of intracellular protein trafficking. As such, HSFA2 plays a role in processes involved when a cell physiologically adapts to spaceflight similar to its role as a universal coordinator of the stress response when plants adapt to a broad range of other environmental changes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref>). However, the expression patterns in the spaceflight-adapted state of the genes related to cell wall construction, signal transduction and starch biosynthesis in HSFA2 KO cells in comparison to WT cells imply more specific roles for HSFA2 beyond the universal stress response coordination. The HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight likely have a fundamentally different architecture from the wild type cell wall, along with diminished processes of cell growth, expansion, and elongation as identified by the altered gene expression profiles. Many genes encoding proteins important to these processes are downregulated in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. For instance, the gene coding glycosyltransferase QUA1 (At3g25140), involved in homogalacturonan biosynthesis and cell Another category of genes that suggested cell wall related roles for HSFA2 in spaceflight adaptation were the secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes associated with wounding (see Section 2.3.2, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3</ref> in the Supplementary Material). For instance, in spaceflight, HSFA2 KO cells overexpressed genes associated with glucosinolate biosynthesis (NSP5 nitrile specifier protein 5, At5g48180) and AOP1 (2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, At4g03070), in anthocyanin and flavinol biosynthesis (SRG1 senescence-related gene 1, At1g17020). These genes, and others in this category of herbivore response genes, were all overexpressed in spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT spaceflight cells (horizontal comparison) <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>. The upregulation of these categories of genes suggests that the cells disabled in HsfA2 responded as they would to an herbivore attack, possibly as a consequence of diminished expression of cell wall remodeling genes, resulting in a thinning of the cell wall in spaceflight-adapted cells.</p><p>The analysis of genes with differentially expressed spaceflight vs. ground control (vertical dimension) of the WT and HSFA2 KO cells further supports the concept that the cell wall remodeling is part of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, and that HSFA2 has a central role in this process. Both cell genotypes engaged the cell wall remodeling genes in their physiological adaptation to spaceflight but with fundamentally different outcomes: the WT cells increased the expression of these genes, while the HSFA2 KO cells reduced its expression of cell wall-related genes in spaceflight relative to their terrestrially grown counterparts (see Sections 2.2.1 and 2.2.2, Table <ref type="table">A1</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6</ref>). The WT cells enhanced the expression of a curculin-like (mannose-binding) lectin family protein (AT1G78860) that was previously identified among the secretory cell wall N-glycosylated proteins in a wall-bound extracellular matrix fraction during citrus pathogen invasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> and is described to be associated with cell wall structural changes and signaling upon biological attack. Also overexpressed in WT cells was an unknown protein (At4g30500) linked to the cellulose biosynthetic process and subtilase (AT1G30600), which exhibits serine-type endopeptidase activity that processes the precursor proteins of the cell wall pectin modification enzymes <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>. Contrary to WT cells, the HSFA2 KO cells mostly downregulated the expression of multiple cell wall remodeling genes previously reported to be enhanced in spaceflight <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. In spaceflight, cells in which HsfA2 was knocked out had diminished expression of cell wall loosening and cell wall elongation genes such as GASA1 (AT1G75750), endoxyloglucan transferase XTH4 (AT2G06850), EXPL1 (AT3G45970), and EXO (AT4G08950), relative to the ground control. These cells also decreased the expression level of genes associated with cell wall composition such as PMR6 (AT3G54920), which was shown to alter the composition of plant cell wall in resistance to powdery mildew pathogen, and Glycosyl hydrolase (AT5G13980), a gene shown to degrade cell wall polysaccharides <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67]</ref>.</p><p>Cell wall remodeling genes associated with developmental processes and genes related to the morphogenesis of anatomical structures also showed diminished expression in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight relative to its ground counterparts (see Section 2.2.2, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S4</ref> drawing on the Left in the Supplementary Material). For instance, genes involved in cell elongation due to cell wall expansion such as GASA1 (At1g75750), EXLA1 (expansin-like A1, At3g45970), and GRH1 (At4g03190), a GRAS family transcription factor SCR (SCARECROW, At3g54220), which functions in asymmetric cell division, and auxin efflux carrier PIN1 (At1g73590), which is involved in the regulation of cell size, were all downregulated in the HSFA2 KO cells that had physiologically adapted to spaceflight (see Table <ref type="table">A1</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3</ref> in the Supplementary Material) <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>. Additionally, 3 genes related to pollen development: 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily protein (At3g63290), ZWI ZWICHEL (At5g65930), and ATACA9, which auto inhibits Ca(2+)-ATPase 9 (At3g21180) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, all had diminished expression in the HSFA2 KO cells adapted to the spaceflight environment.</p><p>An essential conclusion drawn from examining the differentially expressed genes in the vertical dimension was that these genes were not differentially expressed between the two genotypes in the horizontal comparison of the ground adapted states. Therefore, the way both cell genotypes modulated the expression of cell wall genes during the physiological adaptation (vertical comparison) inevitably led to substantial differences in the distinct gene expression profiles of the WT and HSFA2 KO spaceflight-adapted cells (horizontal comparison) (Section 2.3.2). Summarizing, the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight exhibited the diminished cell wall remodeling processes leading presumably to cell wall thinning compared to the ground HSFA2 KO cells, therefore supporting the potential specific HSFA2 roles in the cell wall reorganization in achieving the spaceflight-adapted state.</p><p>Another specific role for HSFA2 in spaceflight adaptation is associated with the plasma membrane. Several genes associated with processes on the plasma membrane were differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO relative to WT cells in spaceflight (horizontal comparison) (see Section 2.3.2, Table <ref type="table">A2</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S3</ref> in the Supplementary Material). Examples include the overexpression of membrane kinase receptors such as: Leucine-rich repeat domain protein kinase family proteins, LRKs (At5g65240, At5g25930), STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 (At1g78980), and BIR1 BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinase (At5g48380) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[73]</ref>. Membrane receptors such as these are essential for myriad processes, including sensing chemical and physical stimuli from the environment. The abundance of the receptor proteins' presence at the membrane translates to cell's sensitivity to the extracellular compounds binding to these receptors and it is possible that HSFA2 KO cells modulated their responsiveness by increasing the receptors expression. It is also possible that in the absence of the HSFA2, the signal transduction from the membrane receptors is altered. The directional link between the expression of the LRR-RLK genes, enhanced expression of HsfA2, and many Hsf and Hsp genes and response to the exogenously administered arsenic was found in Arabidopsis roots, suggesting that HSFA2 may have a function in the response to toxic metals in the growth medium <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref>.</p><p>The HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight seemed to also differ from the spaceflight WT cells (horizontal comparison) in starch biosynthesis (see Section 2.3.2). Genes central to starch biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, such as phosphoglycerate/bisphosphoglyce PGM (At1g78050), isoamylase 1(At2g39930), and NDHN oxidoreductase (AT5G58260), were substantially underexpressed in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight relative to WT. The reports on starch content in plants in microgravity vary with the experiment and plant species <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref>, but it is possible that HSFA2 plays a role in the carbohydrate metabolism and energy reserve metabolic processes in microgravity that contributes to the diverse response of plants to spaceflight.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">HSFA2 is Much More Than a Heat Shock Factor-Things Learned from Space</head><p>Although HSFA2 is part of the Heat Shock Factor network, the molecular phenotype of the HSFA2 KO in response to spaceflight shows that the gene plays an essential role in physiological adaptation that is well beyond simple thermal metabolism. Aspects of that role are revealed by examination of the gene expression differences on the ground between HSFA2 KO and WT.</p><p>Disabling the expression of HsfA2 caused a change in the expression of 349 genes in the ground environment. Therefore, cells that did not express HsfA2 lacked not only one gene, but 349, as they were launched into orbit, and they all potentially contributed to the cells' metabolic state both in the control and in the spaceflight microgravity environment. This 349-gene difference highlights the importance of recognizing the cells' ground adapted state while looking for the differences in the tested environment which, in this study, is the environment of spaceflight. Nearly two-thirds of the genes differentially expressed between the HSFA2 KO and WT ground cells showed diminished expression in knockout cells, which could be explained by the transcription factor function of the HSFA2 (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">S2</ref> in the Supplementary Material).</p><p>The most prominent class of genes underexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground as compared to the WT is associated with protein folding (Table <ref type="table">A2</ref>; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S4</ref> drawing on the Right in the Supplementary Material). These genes included the chaperone, co-chaperone, and no-chaperone coding genes that were reported among the critical protein folding genes in Arabidopsis <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>. Such diminished expression of some chaperone genes was in accordance with the microarray dataset obtained from the A. thaliana HSFA2 KO plants (Array Express accession number E-GEOD-4760) <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>. Additionally, plants overexpressing HsfA2 had elevated expression level of many chaperones in non-stressed conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>. For instance, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing HsfA2 gene overexpressed many Hsp genes, including 18 genes associated with cell rescue and virulence related genes in normal conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>. The overexpression of HsfA2 increased the plant's tolerance to combined environmental stresses, while plants with knocked out HsfA2 gene had reduced basal and acquired thermotolerance and oxidative stress tolerance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>. These observations suggest that HSFA2 regulates the housekeeping expression of the protein folding genes not solely in response to stress.</p><p>The severe underexpression of protein folding genes in the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground that compromised the efficiency of the folding machinery was further manifested by the overexpression of the ER stress genes, notably 3 critical genes of the UPR involved in oxidative protein folding PDIs/ERO1 (alias ATPDIL1-2 (At1g77510), ATPDIL2-1 UNE5 (At2g47470) and AERO1 (At1g72280)). It seems that the HsfA2 mutation compromised the basic maintenance of the protein folding processes that altered the ER homeostasis and that led to ER stress. As the ER stress is a hallmark of the environmental stress response, it can further explain why the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground showed enhanced expression of abiotic stress response genes, particularly genes involved in response to drought, extreme temperature, and high salinity. The genes dehydrin (AT1G54410), a hydrophobic protein RCI2A (AT3G0588), and DREB2B (AT3G11020) were all upregulated in HSFA2 KO cells in the control, ground environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref>. In analyzing the differentially expressed ER stress genes, it seems that if a cell experiences ER stress due to an inefficiency of the protein folding machinery resulting from its genetic background, and not the environment, the cells still send a stress-response signal cascade as they would in response to damaging exogenous or environmental stimuli and activates the stress response. Therefore, the cells actively engaging in the stress response were sent to the ISS, which could explain the hypersensitive features of the HSFA2 KO cells in the spaceflight-adapted state.</p><p>HSFA2 KO underexpressed genes related to oxidative stress tolerance in the ground environment (see Table <ref type="table">A2</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">S4</ref> drawing on the Right in the Supplementary Material). A strong link between HSFA2 and the oxidative stress response and tolerance is well established <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>. For instance, the gene At5g61640 coding PMSR1, a ubiquitous enzyme that repairs oxidatively damaged proteins, was underexpressed in the HSFA2 KO cells on the ground, suggesting compromised tolerance to stress at minimum oxidative stress.</p><p>Fundamental metabolic processes can also be impacted by the environment; carbohydrate metabolism and cell wall remodeling are good examples of where HSFA2 plays a role these types of responses. Genes that are involved in the response to sucrose were also expressed at a lower level in HSFA2 KO cells in the ground-adapted state compared to WT. For instance, the Cold acclimation protein WCOR413 family (AT4G37220) gene, a canonical, highly sensitive sugar-repressed gene <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> was downregulated in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground. In accordance, DIN3 DARK INDUCIBLE 3 (AT3G06850) and MCCB 3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (AT4G34030), both mitochondrial proteins involved in valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation during sugar starvation <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">88]</ref> were also down-regulated. Glucose level may influence protein folding, as high glucose stimulates de novo protein synthesis, making it possible that diminished gene expression of sugar-responsive genes is part of the UPR's strategy to minimize the level of de novo protein translation and to prevent further overload of the ER folding <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>. This connection further reinforces the link between diminished carbohydrate metabolic processes and adaptation to the spaceflight environment as observed in the HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight.</p><p>Cell wall remodeling is influenced by a variety of developmental and environmental cues, and it is well established that there are multiple strategies to achieve an operational goal. The extent to which HSFA2 contributes to the regulation of these strategies was revealed by comparing the expression of cell wall related genes in the HSFA2 KO to WT. It has been demonstrated in many studies that plants in space utilize genes involved in the response to pathogen attack, despite the absence of any pathogens <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. This misconceived pathogen response could be a result of reduced gravity loading causing a distortion on the cell wall, threatening cell wall integrity similar to the physical damage that the cell wall sustains under pathogen wounding or herbivore attack. Both the WT cells and the HSFA2 KO cells differentially express cell wall-associated genes typical of pathogen attach, but not the same genes. For instance, while WT cells engaged PEN2 (AT2G44490), which triggers callose deposition in the cell wall and glucosinolate activation <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[90]</ref>, along with two other genes (At3g43250, AT5G38980) reported to function in wounding and in defense response, the HSFA2 KO cells engaged the Disease resistance protein CC-NBS-LRR class gene (AT1G59124) <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[91]</ref> and NTA Seven transmembrane MLO family protein gene (AT2G17430) <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> instead. All of these genes are involved in mounting a defense in response to pathogen attack, but the gene out of this general class that is utilized depends very much on whether the genome contains an active HsfA2 gene.</p><p>Thus, the differences in the cells' physiological state on the ground dictate the requirement for molecular changes in order to adapt to the spaceflight environment. There was only one gene, At2g03760, coding brassinosteroid sulfotransferase 12 (SOT12), engaged in the same way in both genotypes during the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. The enhanced expression of SOT12 was correlated with actively growing cell cultures and in response to salt, osmotic stress, hormone treatments, but also in the defense response to a bacterial pathogen attack <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref>. However, the physiological adaptation of the WT cells and HSFA2 KO cells shared 2 other genes, the U12-type spliceosome (At3g10400), and the Cystatin/monellin protein of unknown function (At4g03570); yet they showed an opposite change in their relative expression (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5A</ref>, Section 2.4.1). The U12 introns, although rare, are indispensable for normal growth and development of plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>. The U12 intron splicing is part of the non-sense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), which is important for destroying transcripts with premature stop codons <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>. Interestingly, the HsfA2 transcript in its alternative form HsfA2-II is degraded via the NMD pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>. Both genes showed diminished expression in the HSFA2 KO spaceflight cells relative to their ground counterparts, while in the WT cells, the expression was enhanced in the respective comparison. However, both genes were overexpressed in the ground in HSFA2 KO cells compared to WT ground cells. As a result of the expression adjustments that occurred in the spaceflight cells, both genotypes achieved the matching expression level in the spaceflight-adapted state. This solitary example of the two genes underlines the importance of the ground-adapted state gene expression status that mandates requirements for the gene expression changes during the physiological adaptation to the novel spaceflight environment.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Role of HSFA2 in Spaceflight Adaptive Processes</head><p>Comparing the gene expression profiles among space-adapted genotypes allowed the identification of the genes Required to be expressed at certain levels in order for a plant cell to adapt to spaceflight. There were genes uniquely involved in the physiological adaptation of WT cells but not in HSFA2 KO cells, as they were already expressed at a spaceflight-adapted level in HSFA2 KO on the ground (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5C</ref>, Section 2.4.1). Thus, the WT cells needed to alter the expression level of these genes from their terrestrially observed level to express them at a level required for spaceflight survival, while the HSFA2 KO cells arrived at the ISS with these genes already expressed at the required level. For instance, the PDIL1-2 (AT1G77510) gene involved in the UPR and CUL2 (At1g02980), a ubiquitin E3 ligase of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) class, was expressed in HSFA2 KO cells on the ground at the level required for the spaceflight-adapted state (see Table <ref type="table">A3</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>. The cullin protein is a part of a complex that mediates the ubiquitination and subsequent proteolytic turnover of proteins in a highly specific manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>. As mentioned above, with a change of the environment, de novo protein synthesis likely intensifies, increasing the chance for aberrant accumulation of unfolded proteins; thus, some elements of protein metabolism in the ER are indispensable to ensure proper ER homeostasis when the WT cells are exposed to a different environment. As already discussed, the HSFA2 KO cells had the UPR activated in a ground-adapted state due to inefficiency in the protein folding and, therefore, were already equipped with the correcting mechanisms when the environmental change occurred. Some other required genes were related to cell wall remodeling. For instance, a subtilase-like protein (At1g30600), with cell-wall glycoside hydrolase activity, that participates in the processing and/or turnover of cell wall proteins, was upregulated in the WT cells in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but this upregulation was not observed in HSFA2 KO cells, and the WT expression level in the spaceflight adaptive state matched that of the HSFA2 KO cells <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>. Cell wall protein degradation is likely to accompany any changes to the cell wall proteome related to cell wall remodeling; therefore, the expression of genes involved in proteolysis had to be at a specific level in spaceflight irrespective of the cell's genetic background. Another required gene for spaceflight adaptation was the penetration 2 (PEN2) alias beta-glucosidase 26 (At2g44490) gene, which encodes glycosyl hydrolase. PEN2 was already mentioned as a component of the WT physiological adaptation and recruited for broad-spectrum antifungal defense responses by callose deposition in the cell wall <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[99]</ref>. The defense response was a biological process shared by WT and HSFA2 KO cells by the genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Identifying the defense response genes among the set of required genes supports the importance of this process in order for a cell to adapt to spaceflight.</p><p>Using the HSFA2 KO cells allowed identification of genes with expression Corrected to the wild type levels in order for cells to adapt to spaceflight. These genes were uniquely involved in HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to spaceflight and did not have to be engaged in WT cells, as their expression was affected by the absence of a functional HsfA2 gene in the ground-adapted state. Thus, the WT cells did not have to make any adjustments to their expression in spaceflight; only HSFA2 KO cells had to bring the expression to a certain level and thus correct the expression level of these genes to achieve the spaceflight-adapted state (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5D</ref>, Section 2.4.1). These corrected genes in the knockout cells define a new part of the overall landscape of essential genes to achieve a spaceflight-adapted state that would have been overlooked if only WT cells were used. Genes of the defense response, biotic and mechanical stimuli, and cell wall remodeling were already identified in plant wild type cells in spaceflight (see Section 3.2) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">100,</ref><ref type="bibr">101</ref>], yet the utilization of HSFA2 KO cells provided additional insight into the repertoire of genes significant to these responses. The MLO7 Seven transmembrane MLO family protein (At2g17430), FBS1 F-box stress induced 1 (At1g61340), ILL6 IAA-leucine resistant (ILR)-like gene 6 (At1g44350), and AtPP2-A13 PP2-A13 phloem protein 2-A13 (At3g61060) are a few examples of individual genes which respond to wounding, mechanical stress, or external stimuli that had their expression level increased in HSFA2 KO physiological adaptation to match the WT spaceflight levels (see Table <ref type="table">A3</ref>) <ref type="bibr">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr">[103]</ref><ref type="bibr">[104]</ref>. Also, strictly cell wall modification genes, including PME1 pectin methylesterase 1 (At1g53840), NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-fold superfamily protein (At2g02400) that functions in lignin biosynthetic process ENODL17, and early nodulin-like protein 17 (At5g15350) associated with cell wall pectin metabolic process had their expression levels elevated in spaceflight from the level on the ground, so that it matched the WT levels in spaceflight (see Table <ref type="table">A3</ref>).</p><p>Next, genes that encode transport proteins had their expression adjusted in HSFA2 KO cells to that of WT level, so they became evenly expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state. For instance, the transmembrane transporter genes ATATH9 ABC2 homolog (At2g40090), porin (At1g50400) family protein, and GAMMA-TIP aquaporin (At2g36830) were no longer differentially expressed in the spaceflight-adapted state between HSFA2 KO and WT cells, as their expression was adjusted in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells (see Table <ref type="table">A3</ref>). Similarly, nitrate transporter genes ENTH/ANTH/VHS (At4g40080) superfamily protein, and NRT2.7 (At5g14570) were also differentially expressed in spaceflight to match the WT expression levels of these genes. It is, however, uncertain how the loss of HSFA2 function was able to affect the transport of various moieties across the membrane in the ground environment, yet it seems that these transport processes had attained a particular level of efficiency for adaptation to the spaceflight environment.</p><p>The spaceflight environment elicited an accumulation of several branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) degradation enzymes, the expression levels of which were also corrected from a low level of expression to a higher level of expression in the HSFA2 KO cells when compared to the expression level in WT cells in the spaceflight environment. The dark inducible 3, DIN3 gene (At3g06850) coding the subunits of the branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), and two other genes important to small amino acid degradation, MCCB (At4g34030) coding for subunit β of methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase participating in BCKDC reactions, and ALDH6B2 (At2g14170) methylmalonate semi-aldehyde dehydrogenase (see Table <ref type="table">A3</ref>). A large increase in BCAA accumulation can be observed due to environmental stress, such as darkness and carbohydrate starvation <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88,</ref><ref type="bibr">105]</ref>. It is plausible that in the ground environment, the BCAA catabolism was reduced in the HSFA2 KO cells due to the overall problems with the cellular protein homeostasis, while the spaceflight environment elicited an accumulation of BCAAs, similar to that under abiotic stress, thereby raising the demand for the BCAA degradation enzyme function. Overall, using a knockout line greatly increases the list of genes that are necessary to adapt to and survive in the spaceflight environment and thereby amplifies the information gained from rare spaceflight experimentation opportunities to learn what sort of biological processes are necessary, what genes are involved in those processes, and what factors control the expression of those genes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Genotypic Adaptation to Spaceflight</head><p>There were a few genes involved in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight engaged only in WT cells and not HSFA2 KO cells that resulted in the differential expression in spaceflight-adapted state between the two genotypes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5E</ref>, Section 2.4.1). It is possible that without HSFA2 function, cells failed to properly regulate these genes' expression to adapt to spaceflight, and therefore, the expression of these particular genes in the spaceflight adaptation is dependent on a functional HsfA2 gene. For instance, the WT cells increased the expression of ATCSLC12 Cellulose-synthase (At4g07960), suggesting a higher rate of cellulose synthesis and thus cell wall reorganization processes in spaceflight-adapted state (see Table <ref type="table">A3</ref>) <ref type="bibr">[106]</ref>. Cell wall remodeling processes seemed to differ between the two genotypes, and it is possible that the increase in the cellulose synthesis in spaceflight-adapted cells somehow depends on the function of HSFA2.</p><p>An alternative to the idea that genes engaged only in WT cells in spaceflight are dependent on a functional HsfA2 gene is that some of the genes engaged only in WT cells and not HSFA2 KO cells were only required in WT cells but not in KO cells. In other words, it was not the inability to engage these genes that excluded them from those expressed in spaceflight, but rather simply that there was no need for them. For instance, a gene coding the membrane receptor SRF5 STRUBBELIG-receptor family 5 (At1g78980) protein was downregulated in the WT physiological adaptation to spaceflight, but not in those of the HSFA2 KO cells which resulted in lower expression level in WT spaceflight-adapted state than in HSFA2 KO cells. The STRUBBELIG (SUB) receptor mediates the signaling pathway of cell morphogenesis, the orientation of plane of cellular division, and cell proliferation <ref type="bibr">[107]</ref>. It is unclear why the WT cells would diminish the expression of this membrane receptor in spaceflight, yet either a function of HSFA2 is required, or an aspect of HSFA2 KO physiology makes expression of SRF5 superfluous in the spaceflight environment.</p><p>There were a few genes engaged only in HSFA2 KO cells and not WT cells that resulted in the differential expression in spaceflight-adapted state between the two genotypes (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">5F</ref>, Section 2.4.1). It is possible that only cells with a disabled HsfA2 gene were needed to make changes to these genes' expression. This reflects the HSFA2 KO genotypic adaptation to spaceflight environment and likely represents the genes Compensated for the loss of HSFA2 function in that environment.</p><p>Among the compensating genes with enhanced expression was the aforementioned gene of the UPR: PDI-like 2-3 (At2g32920), supporting the importance of the UPR and likely the ERAD, as well as HSFA2 KO, cells in achieving the spaceflight-adapted state (see Table <ref type="table">A3</ref>). WT cells did not need to adjust expression of these particular genes. The ATGSTU25 glutathione S-transferase TAU 25 (At1g171800) gene was another gene with enhanced expression in HSFA2 KO cells in spaceflight. While genes encoding glutathione S-transferase TAU (e.g., ATGSTU1, ATGSTU3, ATGSTU24) were generally overexpressed in HSFA2 KO cells relative to WT cells in either environment, the HSFA2 KO cells further elevated the expression of the glutathione S-transferase genes in spaceflight to compensate for the loss of HSFA2 function in this environment. Similarly, vesicle-mediated transporter genes were among those consistently differentially expressed in HSFA2 KO relative to WT regardless of the environment, but HSFA2 KO induced additional similar genes during physiological adaptation to spaceflight and showed overexpression of such genes in the spaceflight-adapted state. Examples in this category included the Coatomer, beta' subunit (At3g15980), Target SNARE coiled-coil domain protein (At1g29060) and Integral membrane Yip1 family protein (At2g36300) genes related to ER to Golgi and intra-Golgi vesicular traffic, suggesting that these processes needed to be compensated for the lack of HSFA2's function in the spaceflight environment.</p><p>The HSFA2 KO cells decreased the expression of the two calcium pump Ca(2+)-ATPase genes, ACA9 (At3g21180), and ACA2 (At4g37640) resulting in their underexpression in the spaceflight-adapted state relative to WT cells (see Table <ref type="table">A3</ref>). Aside from their involvement in calcium homeostasis and calcium second messenger functions, these calcium pumps were also shown to participate in protein processing in the secretory pathway <ref type="bibr">[108]</ref>. Interestingly, there was another gene with the same expression profile coding, the RMR1 transmembrane receptor (At5g66160) of the intra-Golgi vesicle-mediated transport. The RMR1 functions as a sorting cargo receptor for protein trafficking <ref type="bibr">[109]</ref>. Thus, the HSFA2 KO cell's strategy for adapting to the spaceflight environment included reducing the protein sorting and trafficking to the destination, possibly to compensate for the basic inefficiency in these processes when the HSFA2 was disabled.</p></div>

Briefly, the CEL BRIC17 experiment was launched in the Dragon capsule of SpaceX-3 Commercial Resupply Service (CRS) mission to the International Space Station (ISS) on the 1st of March 2013. The cultured cell lines (both the ground control and the spaceflight samples) were grown within 60 mm Petri plates in Petri Dish Fixation Units (PDFUs) that were housed within the Biological Research in Canisters (BRIC) hardware. The PDFU/BRIC system is a passive, air-tight, non-ventilated, non-illuminated culture system. The BRIC system is certainly not an optimal habitat for plant growth, and its limitations have been reviewed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr">110]</ref>. However, the BRIC habitat is less inimical to undifferentiated cell cultures than for photosynthetic seedlings. In addition, both spaceflight and ground control cells were each exposed to the limitations of the BRIC hardware. The spaceflight samples were launched to the ISS, while the ground controls were "launched" on a 48-h delay, and then maintained in the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The 48-h delay facilitated the downlink of ISS environmental data for programming the ISSES chamber. The downlinked data included environmental conditions on the ISS that were duplicated in the ISSES. Cells were fixed within the BRIC canisters on the ISS with RNAlater TM (Ambion) on the 10th day in orbit, and the ground controls were fixed 48 h later. Twenty-four hours after fixation, the entire BRIC was moved to the Minus Eighty-degree Laboratory Freezer for ISS (MELFI) until the spaceflight samples were transported back to Earth, and the ground control samples were transferred to a standard laboratory -80 • C freezer. The total RNA was extracted from the spaceflight samples and the corresponding ground control samples and subjected to microarrays.</p></div>

A sterile scoop was used to place about 1 g of cells on the surface of a 60 mm Petri plate (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing 6.5 mL nutrient agar media (MS salts (4.33 g/L), 3% sucrose (30 g/L), MS vitamins, 2,4-D 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer (0.5 g/L), 0.8% agar (8 g/L)). The cells were then dispersed evenly across the surface. All plate manipulations were conducted under sterile conditions in a laminar flow hood to assure sterility of both the interior and exterior of plates. Plates were put into a sterile Nalgene™ BioTransport Carrier (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), each layer of plates separated with a sterile non-skid plastic insert. The BioTransporter was then sealed with gas-permeable tape (3M), wrapped in Steri-Wrap™ autoclave wraps (Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) and then driven to KSC. The BRIC17 CEL experiment was turned over to payload engineers in the SSPF (Space Station Processing Facility) at KSC 48 h before the scheduled launch time.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>Conclusions from these data concern non-thermal roles for the heat shock factors in the physiological adaptation of plant cells to spaceflight. First, the heat shock transcription factor HSFA2, and likely the whole HSF network, has important roles in the physiological adaptation to spaceflight through regulation of cell wall and plasma membrane signaling, as well as starch biosynthesis. Second, disabling HsfA2 leads to activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress response and the unfolded protein stress response and dramatically alters adaptation to spaceflight. Without HSFA2, a much larger change in gene expression is required for spaceflight adaptation. Third, the endoplasmic reticulum and unfolded protein stress responses define the HSFA2 KO cell physiological state regardless of the environment, likely because of the deficiency in the chaperone-mediated protein folding machinery. Fourth, the HSFA2 KO cells helped to unravel the HsfA2-dependent genes of the wild type adaptation to spaceflight by identifying a set of genes with a required expression level for a cell to achieve the spaceflight-adapted state, thus suggesting that genetic approaches provide additional insights beyond those revealed by differential gene expression in WT cells. <ref type="table">Table A1.</ref> The selected significant GO terms assigned with AgriGO, gProfiler and ATTED-II to 78 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in WT cells, and 221 genes of the physiological adaptation to spaceflight in HSFA2 KO cells.
