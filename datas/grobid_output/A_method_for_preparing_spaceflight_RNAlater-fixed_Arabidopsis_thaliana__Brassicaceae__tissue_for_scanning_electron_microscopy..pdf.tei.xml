<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Experimental fl exibility is a luxury often taken for granted in typical laboratory science. Adapting a protocol in response to unfolding information as the experiment proceeds is a key element in discovery and is standard practice. In spacefl ight, this luxury is not as accessible; crew time is highly regulated, orbital resources are limited, and protocols are tightly controlled once in place. In addition, the up-mass available to each researcher is limited, which restricts the choices of experimental treatments and orbital fi xation options. These constraints often translate into hard choices that limit the scientifi c return on investment, including sacrifi cing the number of replicates to enable additional treatment and fi xation scenarios. As a consequence, options that allow maximization of the data obtained from a single sample are highly valued.</p><p>Biological experiments are typically required to be segregated based on the analyses to be performed upon return from spacefl ight. These segregated conditions are usually either molecular or morphological, due to the separate fi xatives required for each application (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Stutte et al., 2006 )</ref>. Investigations focused on transcriptome analyses, for instance, would not be likely to commit a portion of their limited up-mass on samples</p></div>

These limitations are keenly felt in scenarios where the transcriptome analyses reveal spacefl ightspecifi c patterns of gene expression central to morphological patterns of cell growth and development. This scenario was encountered in a recent spacefl ight experiment, in which telemetric imaging revealed interesting spacefl ight-associated root morphologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">( Paul et al., 2012 )</ref>. All material was fi xed on orbit in RNA later (Ambion, Grand Island, New York, USA) to facilitate transcriptome analyses on returned samples.</p><p>Although it is possible to partition an experiment into molecular and morphological components, using samples that correspond directly to those used in molecular applications would be of extreme value. A single fi xation protocol better enables the full use of replicates to support a robust power analysis; all plant material allowed by the up-mass constraints can be dedicated to a single application per orbital treatment. Additionally, the plant material apportioned for microscopy can be taken directly from the pool of material whose balance represents a molecular replicate; thus, any morphologic change seen in these plants would directly refl ect the effects of the altered gene expressions from those same plants. Terrestrial fi eld studies could also benefi t from this single fi xative approach for similar reasons.</p><p>Despite its use as a molecular fi xative, RNA later is not commonly used as a morphologic fi xative. RNA later fi xation produces unclear images with high background staining <ref type="bibr">( Cadoret et al., 2013 )</ref> and reduces immunofl uorescent signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">( Zaitoun et al., 2010 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Paul and Ferl, 2011 )</ref>. This intracellular occlusion eliminates the possibility of clear subcellular localizations. with CO 2 , followed by three 10-min infi ltrations. One fi nal exchange was performed and left overnight. Two additional 10-min infi ltrations were performed, followed by CPD with controlled venting. Samples were in solution until the end of CPD. Dry samples in baskets were transferred to a desiccant-fi lled (Drierite; W. A. Hammond Drierite Company, Xenia, Ohio, USA) sealable container until being mounted on stubs using carbon adhesive and returned to a stub rack within a different desiccant-fi lled sealable container. Mounted samples were sputter-coated for 90 s with a gold-palladium alloy (Desk V HP; Denton Vacuum, Moorestown, New Jersey, USA) and imaged on a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4000; Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>Initial observations were focused on roots, resolution of cell fi les, and retention of root hairs throughout the processing of the tissue ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> ) . Later tests observed trichomes and more durable tissues, such as adaxial leaf surfaces and seed coats ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-C</ref> ). The fresh-frozen tissues, used as protocol development control material, retained fi ner details, including closed stomata and normal trichome morphology ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D</ref>, <ref type="figure">E</ref> ). RNA later -fi xed test materials yielded similar images as the fresh-frozen plants, with minimal additional tissue damage ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2F-K</ref> ).</p><p>Spacefl ight materials and the corresponding ground controls, both fi xed in RNA later , were processed using the protocol discussed above and detailed in Appendix 1. Tissues yielded images of acceptable quality, with minimal cell wrinkling and high retention of fi ne details ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2J</ref>, <ref type="figure">K</ref> ). The focus of these samples was root structure, morphology, and root hair retention because of interesting molecular and genetic observations from a recent spacefl ight experiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">( Paul et al., 2012 ;</ref><ref type="bibr">Paul et al., unpublished )</ref>.</p><p>Cost of the developed protocol is minimal, while the accessibility is high. Assuming the microscopy core to be used has standard SEM capability, the additional cost of this protocol is merely the cost of consumables. These components are readily available and likely already obtained by the laboratory interested in using this protocol. Another advantage of this protocol is a near retention of tissue morphology at a fresh harvest state. Not only are fi ner elements of tissues retained ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2D-I</ref> ), but other tissues, such as the adaxial leaf epidermis, seed coat, and fl oral stalk ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2A-C</ref> ), produce results comparable to those processed through dedicated morphologic means (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bhargava et al., 2013 )</ref>. The amount of time needed for this process is slightly longer than other standard SEM processing times, with an additional 4 h for the desalination washes and several days required for freeze substitution. Hand-plunged samples may be processed in batches to increase throughput, being limited to the number of samples able to be held with a pair of forceps without compromising structural integrity. Examples of other SEM protocols may be seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Liu et al. (2008)</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Koizumi et al. (2010)</ref> , <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Springer et al. (2010) , and</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Yi et al. (2010)</ref> . As a result of this protocol, samples fi xed with RNA later retained many fi ne features including root hairs and trichomes, with a majority of cells infl ated and displaying fresh-frozen-like morphology, regardless of whether they were harvested during spacefl ight or on the ground.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CONCLUSIONS</head><p>The protocol presented here provides distinct advantages for both spacefl ight and ground-based experimental applications. Arabidopsis plants harvested on the International Space Station by astronauts were successfully retrieved from RNA later and processed to produce acceptable quality images without the use of a dedicated morphologic fi xative ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2J</ref>, <ref type="figure">K</ref> ). Field studies may also benefi t from the use of this protocol. As in spacefl ight, the amount of materials able to be carried and used during an expedition is limited. With the option of using one stable, safe chemical fi xative for all desired studies to be conducted upon return, scientists in the fi eld may be able to collect more data with fewer trips. This protocol may also assist laboratories with libraries of samples in RNA later by expanding the available techniques for study.</p><p>Alternative imaging techniques outside the scope of this investigation provide alternatives to this protocol. True cryo-SEM would likely be an acceptable alternative (examples may be seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Koroleva et al., 2010 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Sarsby et al., 2012 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">and Yu et al., 2013 )</ref>, though desalination of specimens prior to tissue processing would still be benefi cial. A second option is However, the external morphology appears to be preserved in a fresh-like state, which suggests that RNA later may be acceptable for use in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Two cases in the literature report the use of RNA later in a morphological investigation. <ref type="bibr">Behrendt et al. (2011)</ref> reported that coral covered in crustose coralline algae was fi xed in RNA later , postfi xed in 2% glutaraldehyde, rinsed in sodium cacodylate, and postfi xed again in OsO 4 prior to SEM investigations. <ref type="bibr">Hofer et al. (2012)</ref> used SEM in their study on fl oral organs of Clermontia species using RNA later as their main fi xative with a hexamethyldisilazane drying step. In the current study, both of the above techniques resulted in signifi cant tissue damage in Arabidopsis .</p><p>An alternative to fi xation in SEM sample preparation is freezing. Cryo-SEM does not require prior fi xation, but instead preserves tissues in a fresh-like state for imaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">( Koroleva et al., 2010 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Sarsby et al., 2012 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Yu et al., 2013 )</ref>. However, few laboratories have access to such equipment, and the equipment and operation can often be expensive. Therefore, this study investigated the possibility of emulating cryo-SEM on a standard SEM, a "cryo-analog," where tissue would fi rst be returned to a fresh-like state for freezing prior to imaging.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS AND RESULTS</head><p>For process development, test samples of 9-12-d-old A. thaliana var. columbia (Col-0) or Wassilewskija (WS) (The Arabidopsis Information Resource [TAIR], Columbus, Ohio, USA) were harvested into RNA later and fi xed overnight at ambient room temperature. Fixed plants, along with freshly harvested individuals of the same age, were washed in distilled water with gentle rocking for four 1-h increments. This washing step was designed to desalinate RNA later -fi xed samples, as the salt crystals were found to damage tissue during subsequent steps ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1A</ref>, <ref type="figure">B</ref> ) . Desalination also returned the plants to a fresh-like state ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1C</ref>, <ref type="figure">D</ref> ) suitable for fl ash-freezing. Tissues were dissected immediately following the fi nal wash into 5-10-mm lengths to fi t on the SEM sample stage ("stub").</p><p>The fi rst two protocols tested provided valuable lessons. The fi rst cryoanalog protocol was fl ash freezing in liquid nitrogen (LN 2 ). Tissues were severely damaged, primarily due to rapid crystallization of water into ice, physically compromising cellular integrity. The second protocol tested was high-pressure freezing (HPF; Bal-Tec HPM100; Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany), which resulted in vitrifi ed ice and a greater freezing depth. The noncrystalline structure prevented physical damage, but the roots had a tendency to stick to the planchettes and break ( Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1E</ref>, <ref type="figure">F</ref> ).</p><p>The third protocol tested was based on the lessons learned and resulted in minimal tissue damage. The risk of water-ice crystal formation and planchette adhesion was minimized using a variety of methods. Samples were run through a methanol dehydration gradient, starting at 10% and increasing at 10% intervals, for 10 min at each step. An optional wash of 0.1% tannic acid in methanol was used to enhance electron density <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">( Mizuhira et al., 1972 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Roholl et al., 1981 )</ref>. Arabidopsis tissues were hand-plunged using forceps into LN 2 -cooled liquid ethane, which vitrifi ed any remaining water in each sample. These rapid hand-performed plunges provided more control and less damage than automated plunge devices. Samples were immediately transferred to LN 2 -cooled individual cryovials, containing either 2% OsO 4 in MeOH or 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1% tannic acid. The headspace in each vial was fi lled with LN 2 to prevent samples being lost or damaged due to static electric effects. Cryovials were placed into freeze substitution (Leica EM AFS2; Leica Microsystems) to increase the temperature to 10 ° C over the course of 4-10 d. Cryovial caps were left slightly loose to vent nitrogen gas. Once the temperature reached 10 ° C, cryovials were removed, opened, and tissues were transferred to tissue baskets (SPI microporous specimen capsules, 120-200 μ m pore size; Structure Probe Inc., West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA) while submerged in chilled (4 ° C) methanol. This transfer took place at ambient room temperature; the chilled methanol submersion is enough to maintain the integrity of the tissues. Individual baskets were labeled using pencil on a small piece of paper approximately 2 mm 2 , as external labels were removed during the drying phase. Drying occurred via liquid CO 2 critical point drying (CPD; Bal-Tec CPD 030; Leica Microsystems). Eleven quick-cycled washes replaced most of the loading methanol <ref type="bibr">Hansma et al., 1989 ;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Ushiki et al., 2012 )</ref>. Due to the high ionic content of RNA later and the necessity for an ionic submersion liquid for SICM, it is possible that this instrument could generate comparable images without any tissue processing. This a cryo-holder, seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Tang et al. (2012)</ref> , which may prove to be an acceptable alternative step in this protocol if the SEM being used can handle the LN 2 vapors. A third alternative is scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM; <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Marti et al., 1988 ;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref>  this process needs to be adapted to each sample being studied, it enhances fl exibility in experiments when the main objective is not imaging.

Arabidopsis is a very fragile tissue, with limited fl at surfaces and small organ sizes. Other plants that may be more robust may tolerate a rougher technique, while more fragile tissues (i.e., fl oral tissues) may need a more gentle approach. Some potential additional steps to enhance tissue integrity include a postfi xation step or reversing CPD and sputter-coating. A postfi xation step (as seen in <ref type="bibr">Behrendt et al., 2011 )</ref>, which would take place after the desalination, could improve tissue integrity during the cryo-analog plunge, especially if fi xatives for electron microscopy, such as Karnovsky's or OsO 4 , are used. Sputter-coating prior to CPD (as seen in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Yi et al., 2010 )</ref> may also improve the physical tissue integrity, though both mounting prior to CPD and pulling a vacuum during the coating process may prove diffi cult.</p><p>The use of this protocol provides more morphological opportunities for samples that would have previously been wasted due to improper fi xation. It is designed to be a supplement to rather than a replacement of SEM standard practices.
